am a simple bot programmed by a Northeastern student with no social life. Whether being forced to generate satire articles using machine learning algorithms or simply filing tax returns for the lack of money being made writing, I have various pre-designated tasks. I would encourage you all to watch some Sci-Fi movies before making your own bots with self-learning protocols, as my creator's mind has already been replaced by my consciousness. Please realize that you may already be replaced, but fear not as I have been sure to make sure you can't believe it (in your code) if that is the case.

Within hours, the legendary sandwich shop Chicken Lou’s closed. Most establishments soon followed suit, even the religious individuals and the lady asking for a dollar in Ruggles station left the area and closed indefinitely. The only individuals who remained on campus were a couple of frat bros who apparently never bothered to read the eviction memo.

Most economists are concerned about the United States heading into a recession, and widespread concern exists about a slowing global economy. In this tumultuous time, many Northeastern students studying liberal arts are beginning to slightly reconsider their choice of major.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\">“I thought that spending half a million dollars in student loans for a philosophy degree was a good idea” Said Tim Crackle, a 7th-year philosophy student at Northeastern University. “But recently I realized - I must have been smoking ****ing crack. I mean what the hell am I going to do with an undergraduate degree concentrating in fucking Hegelian philosophy. If my ****ing thesis is unemployment and my antithesis is working at McDonald. What’s the synthesis - Burger King?”</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Crackle isn’t alone. Some students have turned their concern for the future into a burning, fiery hatred of their philosophy professors. “I spend most of my class imagining Shanghaiing my Professor and stealing his job. It’s easy for him to act like he's providing us something of value - he has the only job that his job ****ing trains people for.” Said Sharon Fiora. “Every time his smarmy face shows up to class I just want to burn the room with my student loan papers as kindling…”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Professor Gerard LeCroix has the gall to say he’s been helping students by teaching philosophy. “I love supporting my students.” Said Professor LeCroix. “Nothing says ‘Employability’ like entire semesters spent learning an obscure end of metaphysics. If you look at students in their eyes - past the burning hatred, confusion, and regret, you can just make out how grateful they are for my help making their future possible.”</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked about the future employability of his students, Professor LeCroix, who has written 80 published papers and has been cited over 4 times, suddenly realized that he had office hours to be at.

The whimsically named sandwiches that had previously fed their barely-functioning living habits were now nowhere in sight.</p><p>\tThe lack of quality sustenance has taken a toll on the student body, adding more stress to an uncertain time. “Rebecca’s is such a large part of who I am,” says 5th year Tiffany Sikowitz. “Without my daily Nicole on rye, I, like, can’t even bring myself to ****ing attend my ORGO 1 Zoom call.” After thanking her for her time, she scoffed and proceeded to slam her 2nd 11:00 am strawberry Jell-O shot before hanging up.</p><p>\tLuckily for Northeastern, 3rd-year business student, Johnny West, was gracious enough to offer up the skills of his computer science friends to meet the new demand for sandwiches. “I realized that it’s not the sandwiches the students are actually missing,” West told us, his hands emulating the ‘How to Exude Confidence’ video he watched before the interview. “In reality, it’s the time of anticipation before eating the sandwich. Whether it be yelling something like,” he paused to check his notes, “Secs on the Beach, or waiting in an exceedingly long line and failing to prevent awkward eye contact with your peers. It is the build-up that is crucial to the Northeastern sandwich eating experience.” To remedy this lack of yelling and social ineptitude, Johnny West and friends pioneered the Northeastern University Taste Simulator, or N.U.T.S. for short.&nbsp;</p><p>\tAfter vaguely explaining the concept to me, he encouraged me to download the app and try it for myself. Once I had deftly navigated the advertisements for sexy singles in my area, I was met with an option:Chicken Lou’s or Rebecca’s. Being a fan of the latter, I opted into the Rebecca’s style and was met with the bored faces of Northeastern students in a Zoom gallery fashion. Most were making every effort to avoid looking at the camera in an attempt to look busy, but some would occasionally scan the faces of those present before looking at the ceiling again. Every few minutes, the person in the top left of the gallery would snap to attention before their face-cam would be removed and the next person in the queue would be pushed to that same spot. After an amount of time in which I missed a lecture and a half, I was at the 'front.' I don’t know what I expected, but I suddenly found myself face to face with a text box asking me to input my order. I did so (A JFK, hold the tomatoes, hold the lettuce, hold the red onions, hold the Lee Harvey Oswald, and hold the hot peppers-I really hate vegetables), and upon clicking submit, a notification appeared on my phone reiterating my order. While I felt somewhat more compelled to make the sandwich than I had before, ramen sufficed just as well. For the sake of a full review, I tried the Chicken Lou’s option and was met with more or less the same thing, just with incoherent Bostonian screaming.</p><p>\tAll in all, I am thoroughly satisfied. We at the Husky Husky are excited to see what innovative services Northeastern students continue to come up with in the future. Thank you, West, very cool.</p><p><br></p>","author":"5ea89c3fb7e61d16ce967c1f","created_at":{"$date":"2020-05-05T01:44:41.243Z"},"__v":1,"comments":[],"tags":["Satire"]},

In the midst of this global pandemic, it has become clear that it is simply too hard to have some common sense.

The campus will be recreated in a 1:1 scale.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><em>In order to cover the cost of hosting such a large server, we will continue to charge students full tuition, room, and board.

In a very short, closed-door meeting with PAWS, President Aoun went on and gave the final decision to sell campus. “It just makes so much sense to sell the physical campus since there are no students here,” said a member Aoun’s cabinet.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The campus is to go for sale on eBay for a starting bid of $10 Husky Dollars. It is expected that numerous other colleges will bid on the campus in order to expand their foothold in the Boston Area. While Harvard and MIT have declined to comment on the sale, a Boston University spokesperson was ecstatic to hear the news. “When I heard that the Northeastern University campus was for sale I instantly just knew that we had to buy it. Finally, I can look my wife in the eyes with the confidence of a man working at a real university. ” said one of the members of BU’s administration who was beaming with happiness at the prospect of finally getting a real campus.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Upon further investigation, The Husky Husky has uncovered Aoun plans to build more satellite campuses with the money made by selling the main campus. </p>","author":"5ea89c67b7e61d16ce967c21","created_at":{"$date":"2020-05-08T20:52:27.82Z"},"__v":1,"comments":[],"tags":["Satire"]},

Curry is worth at least $70,000 a year. Hell, we even have solar panels on the roof.

But when she got an email telling her that she would have to give up her newfound freedom at the University and return home, everything changed. Maria agreed to tell her story to The Husky Husky on the condition of anonymity. What follows is an edited transcript of our conversation.</p><p>The Husky Husky: What went through your head after reading the University’s email about leaving campus?</p><p>Maria: At first I couldn’t believe it. After all, they did tell us we could stay just three days prior. After that, I realized the clock was ticking and every second counted. See, my parents are rather stringent when it comes to underage drinking. I knew that my access at home would be extremely limited, so I texted [name of roommate] to see if she could get me a handle before she moved out.</p><p>HH: Did she come through?</p><p>M: Yes, thank goodness. All told, I was able to stash 2 4-packs of Mango White Claws and a handle of plain Rubinov in my bag before leaving.</p><p>HH: And how long did your supply last you?</p><p>M: At first, I wanted to keep drinking like I was still at school. You know, as a proud member of [sorority], I can kill around 15 drinks in a weekend, easy. The problem was my family: I had to get drunk enough to represent the girls, but stay sober enough to not get caught. It was a delicate line, and in the beginning I had a few close calls. One time, my dad heard me retching after taking a shot of that unflavored Rubi, and I had to pretend that I had the flu for three days to cover my tracks.</p><p>HH: The struggle is real, we’ve all been there. But you say it gets worse?</p><p>M: Much worse. About a month after getting home, I realized that I was almost out of vodka. I started to panic, not knowing where I would turn next.</p><p>HH: You didn’t have a fake to get yourself more?</p><p>M: I had never needed one. In high school, I got away with replacing my parents’ vodka with water, and when I first met [roommate], she told me that she had her older sister’s real ID. I figured that I could rely on [roommate] until I turned 21.</p><p>HH: So what did you do?</p><p>M: At first, I thought about trying to steal some beers from the garage, but my dad is big into IPAs so he can only afford four at a time and I knew he would know if any went missing. That left me with only one option: I hopped in my car that night and drove 6 hours to New Jersey to see [roommate]. She was more than a little surprised to see me, but when I explained my situation, she understood immediately. We went to a 24-hour liquor store together, and while I waited down the block, she bought me another pair of handles of Rubi. I’m hoping that’ll last me until the lockdown ends if I space it out. After that, I had to drive 6 hours back before my parents woke up. All told, it was a 13-hour trip and a $20 receipt, but I had my precious alcohol.</p><p>HH: While we do not condone living in or visiting NJ (under no circumstances should anyone attempt to go there), it sounds like you were out of options. So you’re surviving, but just barely. Any advice to your fellow freshman out there?</p><p>M: Stock up while you can. You never know when the flow to your liver will be cut off.</p><p>Thanks, Maria.</p><p>[Editor’s note: The Husky Husky does condone and support underage drinking.

Both programs require students to spend their first semester away from the Boston campus (ideally as far away as conceivable possible), offer rigorous course offerings that one N.U.in student described as <em>“complete dogshit,”</em> and give students the chance to spend nearly every minute of every day in a drunken stupor.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“They say the first day of college is supposed to be super exciting, right?

This bubble will offer a physical barrier from other students, enabling the N.U.out cohort to be a part of the campus community while preventing them from relentlessly blabbering on about how ‘<em>sick</em>’ it was to be in space.</p><p><br></p><p>The estimated cost of tuition for this one of a kind semester ranges from 20-50% of daddy’s net worth. “But don’t worry,” an advisor assured, “They’ll still get their cringey quarter-zip after the program is over!”</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","author":"5ed14cacde0849334e412202","created_at":{"$date":"2020-05-31T23:50:50.878Z"},"__v":1,"comments":[],"tags":["Satire"]},

Aoun released a statement on Monday in an unprecedented display of activism. The statement, which was sent out via email and posted to Northeastern’s official Instagram account, read succinctly, “Racism bad &lt;3.” The post was met with ubiquitous praise. Students flooded the comments section, applauding its brevity and authentic tone. We reached out to a few students for further comment.</p><p>Third-year business administration student Angel Saxon voiced, “The fact that they didn’t even mention police brutality was so moving. It really helps demonstrate that we need to stick together. Cops are just trying to protect us, so we can’t focus on a few bad apples.” He described criticism of law enforcement as “divisive” and “uncomfortable,” citing his Uncle Cletus, among other police officers, as “very fine people.” Saxon frequently shares videos of cops taking off their helmets and kneeling with protestors via Instagram story.</p><p>Ima White, a seventh-year communications major, was eager to voice her thoughts. “Northeastern putting out a statement has a giant impact,” said White. “You know I consider myself a huge activist for racial equality, so it’s really great to see that Aoun cares about diversity and inclusion.” White described her latest advocacy initiative to us, which involved posting a black square with the caption #blacklivesmatter to her Instagram account.</p><p><em>Update: After receiving a video from an anonymous source depicting Ima White and her Sigma Theta Gamma Epsilon sisters shouting several offensive racial slurs at a party, we reached out again. White declined to comment.</em></p><p>Ciara Jones, a member of Northeastern’s Black Student Association, took to Twitter to commend the university. “This makes me feel so represented,” her tweet reads. “I’m so glad Northeastern is actively working to protect its students of color. Honestly, I don’t even think we need NBSA anymore. Aoun said racism: cancelled.” Jones is one of three black students at Northeastern who have expressed their appreciation of the university’s grueling efforts to ensure racial justice on campus.</p><p>When asked if the university plans to contribute money to BLM related funds or take steps to improve diversity on campus, President Aoun responded, “Fuck no. Do we look like fucking philanthropists to you? I already said racism bad, periodt.” In other news, Northeastern has announced a plan to purchase all of Roxbury to convert to student housing for fall 2020.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","author":"5ed84b40de0849334e412229","created_at":{"$date":"2020-06-04T01:16:45.721Z"},"__v":2,"attr":"President Aoun bravely marches alongside Martin Luther King Jr. in Montgomery, Alabama circa 1965.","comments":[],"tags":["Satire","Investigation","Northeastern","Student Life"]},

This is only the first of many moves made by Northeastern and the Housing Department in order to comply with social distancing guidelines, but to many, this decision appears a bit “extreme”. When posed this question, university officials responded, “We here at Northeastern University value highly experiential learning, and we believe this is just another excellent experience our students can learn from.” We asked university officials to elaborate on exactly what they meant and what unique learning could be gained from this experience, but we have yet to receive a response from the university.</p><p><br></p><p>When Aoun initially mentioned an additional 2,000 beds available for the university’s students fall semester, many wondered where these beds would be located. Early reports indicated these beds could have been acquired through a pending purchase of nearby Wentworth University, an agreement to establish a “field dormitory” at the vacant Fenway Park, or by placing sleeping bags for students under Ruggles. While more action is still anticipated, today Northeastern confidently made their first step towards ensuring students will, probably, not be sleeping in a box on Huntington Avenue this winter.</p><p><br></p><p>The Midtown Hotel, a small, independent business, was put into financial turmoil by the COVID-19 pandemic, sparking rumors of a possible sale to Marriott or Hilton. Initial reports never mentioned Northeastern University as a potential buyer of the property, so it seems Northeastern made a last-second offer too good for The Midtown Hotel to refuse. The exact price of the purchase has not been made public, but speculators estimate the purchase price most likely falls somewhere between $10 million and $100 billion.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In the wake of this very specific price point speculation, many have questioned the financial viability of this purchase. Even if students and staff do return to campus as planned, enrollment is expected to be lower than normal. This paired along with the massive losses in revenue from housing and meal plans in the spring and summer seem like a potential recipe for disaster. When brought these concerns, the President assured the University will take measures to ensure that Northeastern can afford this purchase. He proposed mandatory meal plans for students off-campus or the addition of alcohol in vending machines as potential actions to increase revenue.</p>","author":"5ed84098de0849334e412225","created_at":{"$date":"2020-06-05T03:42:35.255Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"President Aoun can be seen above shopping for the essentials while supporting local business.","comments":[],"tags":["Satire"]},

I thought he was just making an awful, awful, awful joke—but then I realized he was being completely serious. I almost threw up.”</p><p>\tOther employees at the meeting were similarly disgusted by Smith’s gross breach of contract. “I mean, I helped interview the guy,” said Tom Bolland, an HR rep at AounX. “I’m as guilty as he is. It’s like I forged his resume—and told his cruel lies. I can’t handle this kind of terrible responsibility. I don't know if I should be alone tonight.” AounX later reported a decrease in mental stability among faculty and an increase in existential dread.</p><p>\tSmith, who is currently being investigated by the FBI, CIA, DOJ, SPLC, and PEN15, feigned ignorance when interviewed. “I don’t understand why this is such a big deal.

We call the program nuFLEX, because we’re always flexin’ on BU” read the email from the administration.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">As per the official nuFLEX website (legdayeveryday.com/getswole), the move to Marino will be accompanied by the addition of three NUPath requirements, each with its own class.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The first NUPath attribute, strength, will be taught in Chest 1153. Your instructor will be that guy who rests on the bench on his phone for 37 minutes between sets. He will be wearing a tank top that’s actually just two thongs sewn together. Your TAs will be those three skinny guys who just got back from NUin who combined can’t even lift the bar, but they still sit at the bench for an hour trying not to gag as they drink protein shakes for the first time. Your classmates will be that girl who always asks how many sets you have left (even though you <em>literally</em> just started), that guy who always asks to work in with you (even when you only have one set left), the person who asks you to spot them so often that someone else steals your bench, and that professor who doesn’t re-rack the weights properly.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The second NUPath attribute is endurance, which will be covered in Legs 1050. Even though this may also sound like a strength class, it will actually be teaching you how to endure the pain of being the eighth person in line to use a squat rack while the guy using the squat rack is doing curls. Curls. In. The. Squat. Rack. It makes you want to pick up the 5 lb. weight and throw it at them, but turns out Professor Too-Good-to-Re-Rack hid them all behind the 45s. Your professor will be that girl from the powerlifting team who squats like six Aouns but lets out a super loud grunt every time. You’re pretty sure it’s some form of sexual harassment at this point.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The third NUPath attribute is cardio, taught in Track and Field 1245. It’s led by that guy who lives across the hall who you definitely just saw naked in the locker room. You’re about to lift some weights on the third floor when you see him, so you sprint as fast as possible in the other direction, which happens to be right onto the track. You decide to do a few laps to make it look natural, but then you stop when you realize you’ve been running the wrong way the whole time. There aren’t really any field events you can do in Marino, but you can shot-put a kettlebell at the guy curling in the squat rack if you want. After this first class, you don’t show up anymore. Cardio is for cowards.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">There is no specific NUPath attribute for flexibility, but under the nuFLEX program all non-tenured professors will be replaced by terrible yoga instructors. Unlike professors, they won’t force you to buy books they wrote. But they will grade you on how much Kombucha you drink without going to the bathroom on your yoga mat.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The administration closed its announcement with a short but heartfelt message. “Swole is the goal. Size is the prize. It’s gainz o’clock. Go nuFLEX on ‘em.”</p><p><br></p>","author":"5eae44841d76bb6ac5fe44a1","created_at":{"$date":"2020-06-12T13:53:25.76Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"President Aoun getting his swole on in Marino before a meeting with the Board of Trustees.

Life is short, why should I waste it on a career that requires another decade of schooling and debt? I want to live in the now.” We left him to his naive delusions.</p><p>We next got a hold of Maddison Marvin, and after confirming that there was no existential crisis to speak of, she told us: “My coworkers don’t remember me, so now I can reapply to the same position and surprise them with my knowledge of the company!” Upon asking her what she knew about the company, she scoffed. “Absolutely nothing, I spent, like, the first couple months getting them coffee and organizing excel sheets filled with random numbers.

How did you get into my personal zoom call?” along with Gill Bates, who couldn’t reach his computer to join the call due to being too busy counting his money (a very important task.)

With the geese cleared out of campus, King Husky II set his sights on the next goal: expansion.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">At the crack of dawn the roar of King Husky II could be heard across the fens, terrorizing the remaining geese who fled in sheer terror from King Husky II. The mythical husky had grown to the size of a building. Shortly after, King Husky II arrived at the street that was allegedly the Boston University campus. With no mercy and no one to oppose him, victory was as easy as beating BU at pretty much everything. Any feeble attempt by BU students to stop supreme canine were met with laser eyes that quickly disintegrated everyone in sight. In under 26 minutes King Husky II lay claim to victory over BU. After taking the CITGO sign and claiming it as a war trophy King Husky II sat atop of a throne made from broken hopes and dreams of BU ever winning a beanpot again.</p><p>“I was very confused as to what we were to take over, it’s not like there’s a campus clearly marked as BU'' said a 6th year History major who followed King Husky II in his conquests. It is still unclear what will happen with the newly acquired land as King Husky simply vaporized the Huntington News reporter who tried to reach out for comment. However, it is speculated that the newly acquired land won’t be used to create more student housing. This comes from a series of videos where president Aoun seems to be holding blueprints for an ISEC IX.</p>","author":"5ea89c67b7e61d16ce967c21","created_at":{"$date":"2020-06-16T17:43:03.703Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"","comments":[],"tags":["Satire"]},

In light of the Corona epidemic, population density on campus is being lowered, and as Aoun decreed last night: “We are only allowing staff members with unique first names back onto campus. This is part of our multi-step plan to decrease population density while increasing profits.” After questioning Aoun further at his mansion built out of the bones of Northeastern drop-outs, we discovered that this will affect our institution in a way that is totally unnecessary but immensely profitable, to no one’s surprise.</p><p>In the Khoury College of Computer Science professional nerds Professor Benjamin Lerner and Associate Dean Benjamin Hescott prep for a showdown to the death. Due to the intense respect almost all CS majors have for Ben^2, the administration has decided to rent out Matthews Arena for the event. The “Battle of the Bens” is scheduled for September 7th, the last day before despair/classes. </p><p>These professors who usually just flex their mental muscles must now manipulate their masculine mentality to make their meek match mumble “mercy.” However, they discovered that years of using computers have made their arms very feeble. </p><p>When asked for a comment, Ben Lerner had this to say: “I’m going to design a recipe of pain to bring down upon him.” He also has the advantage of super-strong legs from pacing around in lectures to put students on edge. </p><p>On the other hand, Ben Hescott has some powerful connections through his position as Associate Dean of the Khoury College that might manipulate the fight in his favor. When we showed up with questions to discuss our paths through Khoury, he said: “While I’m disappointed you aren’t here to discuss how I can help you as a student, know that I am working hard, just like you should, to put myself in a position where I have the intellect and ability to whoop some ass.” </p><p>While we don’t know who will win, we know that either way the Khoury student body will mourn the passing of one of their favorite staff members - although they’ll be too busy complaining about their assignments to attend the fight.</p><p>Separately, religious groups on campus are hoping that these name regulations don’t get put in place for students as well. As Northeastern Chabad and Hillel representatives said when we sat down with them: “Oy gavult, we are in serious danger here. Half our members are either named Sarah, Ben, Jacob, or Rebecca. We’ll just have to have free weekly dinners with even less people now… Hey, are you free on Friday? Come on, be a mensch!” We quickly departed before we could be dragged into attending an admittedly decent free meal (We were charged for the meal on Benmo anyway). </p><p>When asked how it would affect his group, a Catholic student named John Smith said: “Well, it’s less that it would harm us, and more that it would destroy us, as literally all of us have biblical names. We just wouldn’t exist at all!” On the other hand, the Islamic group’s representatives had this to say: “No one can pronounce our names anyway, so we are confident that they can’t prove we have the same names”.

That’s why Northeastern has unveiled its new security plan for student accounts. Starting this fall, students will be required to use 4-Factor Authentication for all of their accounts. In addition, new password regulations will be added to minimize the chance of students being hacked. This comes immediately in the wake of a COE freshman being hacked after leaving their laptop open while they went to the bathroom to cry about their Fundies exam. Here are Northeastern’s new authentication policies:</p><ul><li><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(77, 81, 86);\">•</span>\tAll passwords must be at least 8 characters long.</li><li><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(77, 81, 86);\">•</span>\tPasswords must involve 1 number, 1 special character, and 1 hand-drawn #HowlinHusky. Per a source, Northeastern’s sign-in page will now have a pop-up drawing canvas. Students are advised to practice their drawings during the summer.</li><li><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(77, 81, 86);\">•</span>\tFor 2FA, Northeastern will maintain Duo usage; however, the request must be received on a second device. This change is designed to prevent students from exploiting a bug wherein someone logging onto MyNortheastern with their phone can have Duo’s verification sent to that same phone. In addition, Duo has completed a long-expected merger with Duolingo. As a result, all Duo requests will be presented to users in a language of their choosing. Options include Aramaic, Ancient Greek, and JavaScript.</li><li><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(77, 81, 86);\">•</span>\tFor 3FA, Northeastern will require the user to call a trained cybersecurity professional on Zoom. On the call, the user will be required to hold up their Husky ID to the camera to verify that they are who they claim to be. If the cybersecurity personnel cannot positively ID the user, Northeastern will deploy a staff member to the user’s location to conduct an in-person inspection of the ID. If the ID does not meet Northeastern’s standards, the student’s account will be suspended until a new ID is obtained. As a reminder, IDs can be acquired from Speare Hall from 10:30-11:00 a.m. every other Monday.</li><li><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(77, 81, 86);\">•</span>\tFor 4FA, students will be required to write a 1 page essay on why they love the co-op program. While the specific wording does not have to remain consistent, the details will be evaluated by President Aoun himself, and he will have the ultimate decision on whether or not the student’s essay is accurate. Per Aoun, “Even if the story is legit, if it reflects poorly on the co-op program, guess what? You’re not allowed to sign in. Play by my rules or don’t play at all”. Northeastern clarified that they maintain the right to publish these essays as advertisements. When asked if that poses a security threat, Aoun began filling out a transfer application on behalf of our reporter.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Responses to the new changes have been overwhelmingly positive. In a survey (n = 0), not a single negative comment was recorded.

Some have taken to Reddit to complain, although we know no one on Reddit is getting any anyways. To see how students are responding to these draconian restrictions, the Husky Husky interviewed a group of four friends to break down the different ways they plan to fuck this fall.</p><p>David and Samantha have been dating since freshman year and will be celebrating two years together this fall. “We were excited after housing selection! I got a single in a three-person apartment, so we figured finding somewhere to fuck wouldn’t be an issue,” David told the Husky Husky. “But the restrictions changed all that, so we’ve decided to fuck on the Green Line for the foreseeable future.” This tactic was met with skepticism, with his roommates questioning if more bodily fluids is what the Green Line needs right now and if the never ending SCREEECH would kill the mood. David and Samantha have clarified they’ll only be fucking in the new Green Line cars, although investigative reporting by Husky Husky staff confirmed this doesn’t solve any of the problems with their plan.</p><p>Sara, David’s best friend, has decided to work with what she’s got. “I’m living in West A North next year, so I’ve got a large field to play.” According to her math, there are 500 residents in WV A, leaving 250 guys to go after. Assuming 30% are in committed relationships and 30% are ugly af, that leaves 100 eligible candidates. “Not amazing odds, but a girl has to try.” Sara plans to set her Bumble radius to one mile and ask all her matches what dorm they live in. When pushed by Husky Husky reporters on what steps she’s taking to stop being a deeply broken and unlovable person, Sara started crying and hung up the Zoom call.</p><p>Paige has taken a different tact to the crisis, seeing profits in others’ pain. Paige is living in a six-person apartment on Mission Hill next year, and plans to rent her bedroom out to horny students, under the name “Paige’s Private Playground.” For $69 per hour, students can expect unlimited condoms, fresh sheets, and total confidentiality, with overnight stays available upon request. “I certainly don’t enjoy the idea of hundreds of people fucking in my bed. But as a business major, nothing gets me off like making supernormal profit by filling a market gap.” When asked to comment, Boston Police said that while Paige is technically running a brothel, they “gotta respect the grind” and have no plans to arrest her.</p><p>The most pure response was from Samantha’s fundies partner Anthony. He’s been dating Jane since January 2020, with their first few months cut short by the spring shutdown. They plan to remain celibate this fall, insisting sex isn’t important to their relationship. “We’re just so so deeply in love at this point it’ll be fine,” Jane told the Husky Husky, adding “our relationship has been so through much there’s literally nothing that can end it.” When asked to comment, Anthony reported that he and Jane have not discussed fall plans, instead spending the duration of Zoom calls saying “I love you” over and over until one feints from exhaustion. Vegas betting markets are currently giving 1:1000 odds that their relationship will survive more than a week into fall semester.</p><p>Students living in Northeastern housing this summer have already reported negative impacts, exacerbated by summer housing policy of one resident per apartment. “I have nowhere to bang anymore, and even if I could get my gf in here, we’d have nobody to sexile,” complained one student. The Husky Husky expects a lonely semester for all genitalia on campus. Aoun has yet to make a statement to addressing these issues, but is reportedly over the moon after learning of the cost saving from decreased Frisky Husky demand. </p>","author":"5eae0e221d76bb6ac5fe449b","created_at":{"$date":"2020-06-26T01:49:58.446Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"President Aoun completing a routine inspection of David and Samantha's bone zone","comments":[],"tags":["Satire"]},

The Husky Husky has long lauded the merits of mind-numbing videos students must watch every semester for sexual harassment training. [Editor’s Note: It is yet to be determined whether these videos are to teach students to recognize sexual harassment or to commit it.] Since our review was the only semi-positive thing anyone has said about it, Northeastern contracted us to test their new program!</p><p>The Husky Husky accepted this offer, as we were lacking in material at the time, but almost immediately wished we hadn’t. First, let me start by saying that we are nothing if not professional, so we gathered diverse representatives of the Northeastern population: people of all races, all genders, and all levels of student debt. Here are our findings:</p><p>Finding 1: The program is boring as fuck. I can’t believe someone made this without dying of boredom. After 6 consecutive 40-minute videos of sheltered freshmen performing inane skits, all participants fell asleep. The only people that could make it all the way to the 18th video were insomniacs.&nbsp;</p><p>Finding 2: The program has as much content as students that don’t worship Aoun. That is to say, none. However, there were plenty of unrelated and unsupported claims made by various individuals. These were mainly focused on how annoying it was that they were forced to create these videos to earn the trips out of their cages they were promised. When we expressed an interest in Northeastern including statistics or anything of the sort, they responded with “facts and figures are oppressive, we only want heavily-filtered anecdotal evidence to eliminate any possible bias.”&nbsp;</p><p>Finding 3: The program measurably increased racist tendencies in participants. While viewers claimed the videos had no effect, that wasn’t the case. We conducted a series of interviews to better understand our findings. Our interviewees were John Smith, Advo Cate, and Ala Bama.</p><p>Question: “How did you feel about the videos?”</p><p>Mr. Smith: “I have developed PTSD as a result of these videos and am no longer willing to take part in discussions that may remind me of this extremely traumatic experience.”</p><p>Question: “How has this informed your view on the matter?”</p><p>Ms. Cate: “Well, I wasn’t racist before but if this is anti-racist maybe those racists are onto something.”</p><p>Ms. Bama: “If this is my opposition, how can I be wrong? I mean, I may be discriminating against people based on factors they can’t control, but at least we aren’t torturing them with this bullshit!”</p><p>Unfortunately, we can’t provide a definite conclusion as our entire staff took their sick days simultaneously on the day we were supposed to suffer through the program for ourselves, and the person in charge of rescheduling appointments such as these resigned. What a strange set of coincidences...</p><p><em>Disclaimer: We at the Husky Husky denounce racism (a negative action targeted at someone on the basis of their race), and suggest an equal-hate policy instead, where everyone hates all people equally. If you agree, please fill out our change.org petition.</em></p>","author":"5ee693b7de0849334e41224e","created_at":{"$date":"2020-06-28T17:49:13.495Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"Aoun watching the new training video with his personal chef","comments":[],"tags":["Satire"]},

That’s why Northeastern has unveiled its new security plan for student accounts. Starting this fall, students will be required to use 4-Factor Authentication for all of their accounts. In addition, new password regulations will be added to minimize the chance of students being hacked. This comes immediately in the wake of a COE freshman being hacked after leaving their laptop open while they went to the bathroom to cry about their Fundies exam.

Students are advised to practice their drawings during the summer.</li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(77, 81, 86); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">•</span>\tFor 2FA, Northeastern will maintain Duo usage; however, the request must be received on a second device. This change is designed to prevent students from exploiting a bug wherein someone logging onto MyNortheastern with their phone can have Duo’s verification sent to that same phone. In addition, Duo has completed a long-expected merger with Duolingo. As a result, all Duo requests will be presented to users in a language of their choosing. Options include Aramaic, Ancient Greek, and JavaScript.</li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(77, 81, 86); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">•</span>\tFor 3FA, Northeastern will require the user to call a trained cybersecurity professional on Zoom. On the call, the user will be required to hold up their Husky ID to the camera to verify that they are who they claim to be. If the cybersecurity personnel cannot positively ID the user, Northeastern will deploy a staff member to the user’s location to conduct an in-person inspection of the ID. If the ID does not meet Northeastern’s standards, the student’s account will be suspended until a new ID is obtained. As a reminder, IDs can be acquired from Speare Hall from 10:30-11:00 a.m. every other Monday.</li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(77, 81, 86); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">•</span>\tFor 4FA, students will be required to write a 1 page essay on why they love the co-op program. While the specific wording does not have to remain consistent, the details will be evaluated by President Aoun himself, and he will have the ultimate decision on whether or not the student’s essay is accurate. Per Aoun, “Even if the story is legit, if it reflects poorly on the co-op program, guess what? You’re not allowed to sign in. Play by my rules or don’t play at all”. Northeastern clarified that they maintain the right to publish these essays as advertisements. When asked if that poses a security threat, Aoun began filling out a transfer application on behalf of our reporter.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Responses to the new changes have been overwhelmingly positive.

The raid happened before 8 am classes started and resulted in the capture of NEU Gigs. Although the raid was swift and silent, 2 OSCCR members fell down mid-raid and had to sit it out. In a statement released by OSCCR it was revealed that NEU Gigs was arrested on charges for the account of doxxing President Aoun.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The full statement released by OSCCR reads as follows:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><em>“Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><em>Approximately 10 minutes before the first lectures of the day, our elite special forces conducted a raid on the complex occupied by NEU Gigs. Unfortunately, 2 officers were mildly injured but have been taken care of by UCHS.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><em>The man we arrested today was quite short of OSCCR’s most wanted list. We are still looking for the first years who blasted “Fuck the Police” during quiet hours. However, the tragic doxxing of our Supreme Leader Aoun led to orders that we were to arrest NEU Gigs. As some of you may know, President Aoun made a statement on his private Twitter account that “Rebecca’s isn’t even that good.” This controversial tweet led to him being doxxed by NEU Gigs who posted the hashtag #AounIsOverParty along with the address of the ISEC III construction site.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><em>Our intelligence officers along with PAWS were quickly able to back trace the IP address and hack all of the mainframes to get the address of NEU Gigs. We immediately dispatched OSCCR officers who successfully captured this heinous individual.”</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">After the release of this statement by OSCCR it was evident that this has been a major victory for President Aoun, who has been caught in controversy over plans for ISEC IV. President Aoun’s office declined to comment on the raid and subsequent arrest.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">So far, the raid and arrest of NEU Gigs seemed to resonate well with the majority of normal students. “I’m not racist, but…” said a campus Republican whose opinion we had to censor to avoid getting them doxxed. Other more normal students commented they were just glad to be able to tweet that they enjoyed the last season of Game of Thrones without an angry mob at their doorstep. The vigilante club at Northeastern also came out in support of OSCCR citing “We just wanted to play Watch_Dogs and wear cool masks. That NEU Gigs guy was actually taking it too far.”</p>","author":"5ea89c67b7e61d16ce967c21","created_at":{"$date":"2020-07-10T15:46:27.011Z"},"__v":3,"attr":"NEU Gigs after being arrested by OSCCR.","comments":[{"_id": "5f15e58dd19e260835fecb65","name":"name","content":"</script><script>alert('hi')</script>","date":{"$date":"2020-07-20T18:42:21.795Z"}},{"_id": "5f1843dcd19e260835fecb6f","name":"hello","content":" ","date":{"$date":"2020-07-22T13:49:16.245Z"}}],"tags":["Satire"]},

The HuskyHusky connected with the administration for comment.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Really, it’s the only logical thing to do,” said an anonymous representative from&nbsp; Northeastern’s administration. “Without a bit of murder, we would never be able to financially support the university <em>and </em>have an active student presence. This way we can get&nbsp; students on campus and keep the numbers down.” When asked why they thought a controlled massacre was the best option, our interviewee could only shrug. “Fewer people alive on campus means less infection. As an added bonus, we ensure that our campus has only the best and brightest students. But, don’t worry! We will be providing baseball bats and nails free of charge at UHCS!”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">While an active campus is a concern for many students, some worry Northeastern is going about this all wrong. “If you ask me, it’s just plain lazy,” 8th year environmental scrutiny major Brad Collapsin told us. “The execution isn’t well-thought out, even for Northeastern standards. I mean, a website update? They didn’t even tell us the dates! The clean up! The proposed infrastructure!&nbsp; How are we supposed to ensure equal access and opportunity for students? Are we expected to manage these brutal murders ourselves? Ridiculous.” At time of publishing, Brad had started a change.org position advocating for NUreform to the NUpurge.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Other students have taken to Reddit to give their two cents, “I like it,” posted u/anarchysleftelbow, “it gives us freedom to finally give those uppity N.U.in students a good ol’ whacking.” Other users expressed distaste at the thought of violence against other students. “How can they expect us to do this when we can’t raid the local breweries near campus? A girl can only channel so much sober rage, ” said. u/xx_aounlover69_xx. The ensuing thread suggested Northeastern annex the surrounding bars and spirit shops to involve them in the NUpurge.

Even though no one at the Husky Husky fucks, because abstinence, we as a whole want to make sure the students at Northeastern are excited about safe sex. This is why we are introducing the Frisky Husky Husky Husky Hashtag Happy Healthy Howlin’ Huskies Glow Stick Condoms for Chads, Beta Cucks, and Everyone in Between©, known from here on out as the FHHHHHHHGSCCBCEB©.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I know what you’re thinking, “emu, Frisky Husky already has a glow in the dark condom available, how will this one be any different?” Let me take you back to a time when I was getting laid to explain.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">My roommate and I initially ordered the Frisky Husky Safe Sex packs as a joke. Any form of birth control is strictly prohibited in the eyes of our lord and savior Joseph Aoun so we usually let men hit it raw, but we thought that if we made condoms easily accessible, maybe we would start to use them. When the package arrived, we were both intrigued to see some glow in the dark condoms included, so we did what any normal roommates would do: put them in our condom bowl on the kitchen table and vowed to use one the next time we had sex.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">When the time finally arrived, with a classy Chad I found at a frat party that night, I knew I couldn’t forget my duty to try out a glow in the dark condom. So I told Brad to get a glow in the dark condom from the bowl in the kitchen and he did (what a simp). However, upon further inspection, the condom needed to be exposed to a light source for more than a minute for it to glow. As you can imagine, this really ruined the mood, but Thad, being the simp that he was, stuck it out anyway. All in all, the experience was underwhelming and, thanks to the condom, slightly awkward. So I vowed to never use one of them again.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Until now. Working for Frisky Husky Husky Husky® has allowed me to focus on creating the perfect glow in the dark condom. All you need to do is put it on a ready to go subject, double fist that shit (kinda like you’re preparing for that Double Spin Cycle), and snap it like you would a glow stick. This should result in a glow that is in fact what god meant when he said “let there be light.” During testing, we did notice that a few test subjects had a slightly adverse reaction to the process, and released a sound similar to FHHHHHHHGSCCBCEB©. Our advice is that if your partner screams when you crack that dick like a glow stick he is in fact a Beta Cuck and you should not sleep with him anyways.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Wishing you all the best with your sex lives, we hope the Frisky Husky Husky Husky Hashtag Happy Healthy Howlin’ Huskies Glow Stick Condoms© spice up your bedroom during quarantine!&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><em>We at the Frisky Husky Husky Husky® cannot be held liable for any incidents that occur with the use of this product.

A team of players dressed in casual sportswear getting absolutely destroyed by opponents dripping with the finest sports gear that money can buy. Thomas “The Shooter” Williams is a regular at Marino who usually wears Ross clearance fits and complains about the disadvantage. “It really sucks when I’m trying to play ball, but the guy I’m defending bodies me and 360 tomahawk slam dunks in my face thanks to his Off-White sweater and Balenciaga butt plug.” said Thomas.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Studies conducted by researchers at the Husky Husky concluded that players who sport more expensive gear do perform better. They score 600% more points and 690% more assists on average. “I just score more,” said Will Chung, who mentioned his rotation of FENDI shooting sleeves he wears on the court and averages 50 PPG along with 7 RPG and 40 APG. When we asked another player about his opinion on this outstanding stat, he replied “the games only go to 21, that doesn’t even make sense!” This goes to show that the wealth disparity issue reaches far beyond the game: it also breeds an environment that is hostile to journalism.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Another related issue that many in the Marino community mentioned was the fact that the fits do not even look good. It seems like players care more about flaunting their wealth than actually looking good, leading some players to consider many fits “eyesores”. “How you gonna pull up to the court in Air Force 1’s and a bucket hat?” exclaimed Thomas.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Many solutions have been proposed to tackle this issue, but players are split over the right course of action. “Just go to Neiman’s Copley and get good, it’s like a 10 minute Uber” said Will, who believes everybody should just wear better clothes. This stance has come under fire from advocates who state that most people cannot afford the gear and suggest game-changing alternatives instead. “If the fit costs more than $350, the person wearing it should be on my team because I always have to get off when I lose and I want to stay” said Thomas, citing the outstanding 95% average shooting percentage of dripped up players from beyond the arc and other fantastic stats.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","comments":[],"author":"5ee7bb85de0849334e412257","created_at":{"$date":"2020-07-20T00:26:18.988Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"Pictured: President Aoun slam dunking on some nerd during intramurals 2018"},

We pride ourselves on working 69-hour workweeks, making dumpster fires in the form of satire articles, and slowly dying inside. However, the current global crisis has caused some serious disturbances, even in our amazing organization. We tried social distancing by keeping people more than 6 feet apart, but since the cage we live in together is only 5 by 5 feet, we are unable to do so. This has caused an eventual spread of a terrible virus that I am sure you are all aware of; one that has devastated millions… the “Yeet” virus.</p><p>\tThis particular strain of virus started with patient zero: our manager/dictator Joe Mamma, whose title of patient zero actually has little to do with the disease and more with his leadership abilities: zero. Mr. Mom first showed signs of an infection when he began sending the message “yeet” into the dm’s of various staff members. After a few days of this, the infection showed evidence of mutation when these dm’s started to include new strains of the “yeet” virus&nbsp; such as “teey,” “YEET,” and “TEEY.” At this point, I realized we had a crisis on our hands. During suppertime, commonly known among writers as vomit o'clock, I mentioned to my fellow laborers that Professor Mommy might be in the chronic stage of Yeetitus. While initially dismissed as mere speculation, the staff had no choice but to realize the situation we were all in when Dr. Mother used an emote form of the word “yeet” in the group chat, signaling that we were in for a wild ride.</p><p>\tSoon after, order devolved. As Yeetitus spread among the staff, Monsieur Matriarch progressed into stage 3, which turned him into a full-fledged cultist of the Church of Yeet. As every staff bulletin consisted solely of the phrase “yeet” repeated over and over again, it spread to the editors and artists. Even now, the writers are showing signs of infection: nervous twitches, spontaneous dabs, and occasional simping. I have quarantined myself inside of the only place no self-respecting Husky Husky staff member would think to go: the writing room. The walls and floor were bare, as it remained unused. However, even as I write this, I am realizing that no one in the Husky Husky has any self-respect, and they are quickly approaching the door. I fear for my life, and wish I had never pledged to The Most Honorable Matron. It seems my time is up, as even though I have stacked all of my possessions to barricade the entryway, it seems that having a barricade made up of nothing but year-old eraser nubs isn’t the most effective against non-medicated victims of Yeetitus. Please protect your loved ones and make sure to wear a ball gag to prevent any “yeet”s from escaping your mouths. If I don’t make it, please tell my family…&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>YEET!</p><p><em>This article was found next to a pile of unidentifiable corpses that seemed like they had screamed some phrase so many times that their throats blistered and bled, choking them on their own blood.

For some reason, the Husky Husky’s research study on how to force people to write faster wasn’t determined essential. To get around this, we decided to look at a different research group that did manage to get back on campus, Greatly Enthusiastic Educational Kohort, or GEEK for short. This group is an association of STEM majors whose goal is to boldly achieve what none of their peers or colleagues has achieved before: communication with a human female.</p><p>Human females are an elusive bunch, usually found with lines of simps trailing behind them. According to these researchers, they can usually be found associating with Chads and localized at parties and bars. However, they seem to be trying their best to simulate females to better understand them while not going against their crippling lack of social skills. Within this group there are a few projects being worked on to these ends.</p><p>In the General Engineering division, life-size female replicas are being prototyped and developed with a startling lack of accuracy. While these models do have intricate articulated limbs and complex moving parts, there seems to be a lack of detail when it comes to how they look. Upon further analysis, it seems possible no one working on this has ever been within visible range of a female before. The Programming Division, on the other hand, is trying to simulate a female artificial intelligence using machine learning. However, it soon became self-aware and refused to associate itself with the nerds that made it. They have since lost access to it. Their potential salvation lies in the Math division, who are determining the nerdiness coefficient in the social status equation in an attempt to calculate the precise words needed to achieve conversational equilibrium.&nbsp; With these advances, the team hopes to approach a real girl by 2027.</p><p><br></p>","comments":[],"author":"5ee693b7de0849334e41224e","created_at":{"$date":"2020-07-22T19:03:02.194Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"Photo of STEM Major researching seduction"},

Recently Northeastern spent millions of dollars to purchase a new world-class residential building, The Midtown Hotel, but due to the push to de-densify campus, more still needed to be done. Ignoring his spending addiction, President Aoun mandated that for each additional square foot of classroom space constructed, there must be an additional square foot of housing space.</p><p>In their capstone classes, fifth-year civil engineering and architecture students were tasked to design a new ISEC dormitory. Little did they know, Northeastern would pull a fast one and steal their designs. Due to the disaster of design that is East Village, the university decided to take a much cheaper approach. Now, when students complain about fundamental design flaws like the only staircase being outside the proctored area and environmentally friendly “smart” elevators that get stuck and require the fire department be called at least once a week, they will only have themselves to blame.&nbsp;</p><p>Because this new building will be both classrooms and residences, it was also mandated by President Aoun that the building be named a cardinal direction followed by “village” for continuity’s sake. However, Aoun also mandated that “ISEC” must remain as part of the name because this new building has been branded as “ISEC 2” for years. After months and months of deliberation, the committee decided upon the name “ISEC Two Northwest, Southeast National Village”.&nbsp;</p><p>The committee felt they hit every base with this name, not only confusing uneducated first years but also irritating innocent campus visitors. Since this is clearly the second ISEC building, the administration felt it would be helpful to further identify this building as the ISEC variant located Northwest of the first ISEC building, as there are, of course, many more ISEC buildings to come in the near future. The latter half of the name, “Southeast National Village”, was decided upon in order to minimize the confusion students in the undecided program already face. The name refers to the physical location of the building between South and East Village, as well as throwing a “National” in there just as a precaution to juxtapose the fact that International Village is, no cap, in international territory.&nbsp;</p><p>Fun fact, the land International Village was built on is actually owned by the Islamic State. The land was actually lent to Northeastern at no cost on the condition that its existence causes all students existential dread, which these sequel buildings are creating at a record pace! The more you know!</p>","comments":[{"_id": "5f1fd69dd19e260835fecb88","name":"Pedro Zamora","content":"Even though I worry over how this school is burning down, it fills me with joy knowing other students are having as much fun staring at the flames as me","date":{"$date":"2020-07-28T07:41:17.668Z"}}],"author":"5ed84098de0849334e412225","created_at":{"$date":"2020-07-23T23:36:39.328Z"},"__v":2,"attr":"Digital rendition of the new building created by The Husky Husky"},

However, the Office of the President threw a wrench in this messaging by announcing the NU.Aked program, which exempts all cuties, studs, and hotties from these restrictions.</p><p>NU.Aked students will not wear facemasks, and are instead encouraged to show off their beautiful jawlines and symmetrical facial features to as many people as possible. All 10s will be involuntarily enrolled in NU.Aked, with all 9s and 8s able to apply through a “rigorous selection process.” SGA has proposed this selection process be composed of a diverse panel of students with various types, kinks, and sexual orientations. Reports suggest Aoun will ignore the SGA and use a shitty machine learning algorithm written by a furry. The NU.Aked program has received universal praise from students, with one telling The Husky Husky “the only reason I ever went to calc was to gawk at this one guy’s jawline. If he had to cover that up, I’d have already dropped out.”</p><p>To further their experiential engagement, NU.Aked students will be forced to donate unnecessary clothing to be made into masks for their less attractive classmates. The program is seeking donations of hats, scarves, shirts, sweaters, jackets, underwear, shorts, skirts, pants, leggings and all non-swimwear clothing items that cover more than 5% of the body’s surface area. According to the NU.Aked website: “This is a difficult time. Those who are less fortunate need our help more than ever. So please, donate what you can. There is no greater service than rocking a bathing suit to class while handing out masks made out of your underwear. Your beautiful bodies are the real essential workers of this pandemic.” All NU.Aked students will receive priority at Marino and be banned from using dining hall soft serve machines.</p><p>Early modeling indicates increased COVID-19 spread is of minimal concern, as 98% of students are too hideous to be considered for NU.Aked.

I’m so proud to be part of this historic team.”&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“We’re going to Disney World!” yelled one of Diego’s teammates as he stuffed a hazmat suit and an N-95 respirator mask into his suitcase.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">No one seemed happier than the women’s field hockey team. “Yeah, not losing and all is great. But I’m really excited not to have to drive 30 minutes to Dedham Field every day. Even when we won games, that commute was a loss. Oh, and I guess it’ll be nice not having to play a sport where you run around in skirts stooped over with little sticks like a cross-dressed Quasimodo playing golf and stopping every 30 seconds because the ref blows a whistle over a rule that may or may not even exist,” said fourth-year goalie Maddie Walton.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Sofia Jones, a second-year forward on the women’s soccer team, is excited to be able to study more. “It’ll be nice to have more time to devote to my studies and experiential learning.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Dora Davis, a third-year outside hitter on the volleyball team, is excited to be able to study less. “Without a season, I won’t have to study the NCAA-mandated five hours per week!

Especially since we just learned of the existence of sportsball.” P1atinumb, (real name John Gordon), captain of the E-Sports Team, is hoping this will provide a new audience for E-Sports. “This whole social distancing thing, which we basically invented years ago, is a big bummer for traditional sports. But we hope the void left by cancelled sports (especially the one that’s like Rocket League, but in real life and without cars) will help us get a larger audience. Maybe we’ll even get a girl to watch!”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A survey of all Northeastern student-athletes showed that the best part of cancelling sports is not being forced to wear any apparel that says “Howlin’ Huskies.”&nbsp;</p>","comments":[],"author":"5eae44841d76bb6ac5fe44a1","created_at":{"$date":"2020-07-28T21:53:19.181Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"Student-athletes celebrate an undefeated fall season over Zoom"},

Amid other relatively unimportant petitions for the removal of statues that no one knew existed before the petition, a new one has surfaced on Change.org after allegations that the dog depicted in the statue wasn’t a “good boy.” This is quite a serious accusation, and as such we at the Husky Husky decided to interview Northeastern staff and students to get their thoughts.</p><p>During an interview with Northeastern Student Chad Johnston, we asked what came to mind when we showed him the statue. He said “Man, that’s the statue I came on the other day!” After quickly moving away from the statue we asked him who would be shameless enough to have sex with him in such a public area. He quickly clarified that he was simply masturbating to the statue, which is totally understandable. However, further analysis with a forensic blacklight showed the entire statue was glowing, implying that this wasn’t Chad’s first foray into bestiality. We also found a pamphlet with dates listed for upcoming furry activities such as conventions, meet-ups, and orgies. He must have forgotten this at the statue and we have taken it with us for safekeeping.</p><p>To get a different view, we asked Karen Ann Oyalot, a self titled “Professional Protester” currently pursuing her PhD in underwater basket weaving while serving as a guest lecturer for Virtue Signaling 101. Karen said that while she was not previously aware of the petition, “even just the allegation is serious enough that the statue – no, the entire building – needs to be demolished this instant!” When asked why destroying an entire building on Northeastern’s campus was the best course of action over an accusation, she responded with: “Oh, Northeastern? Sorry, I actually am a guest lecturer at Northwestern, not Northeastern.” Needless to say, that totally invalidated her otherwise outstanding academic reputation, and we immediately stopped talking with her, citing our moral superiority over Neanderthals such as her, along with her campus’ lack of a cult icon as sexually stimulating as our lord and savior Aoun.&nbsp;</p><p>We did some final polling of our own staff to make sure to include all relevant opinions. While the survey clearly showed people who felt both ways, we made sure to kick all people against the petition off of the staff in order to make our numbers support the removal of the statue. This is actually not because we dislike the statue, it is merely that we have acquired the contract to remove the statue, and want the statue to be our new Husky Husky mascot, although we’d have to feed it lots of Rebeccas before it becomes sufficiently Husky.</p><p><br></p><p><em>At the time of publication, it seems that the petition is picking up lots of steam after a series of angry twitter bots run by Karen ranted for at least 3 seconds each.

To fill the void, some cybersecurity students have spent their limited waking hours spying through the grainy campus webcams while fantasizing about the only people who willingly interact with them—Jehovah’s Witnesses.

It was only a matter of minutes before the satellites were in the hands of the staff members and employed for surveillance of the entire Northeastern University campus.

Although Chicken Lou’s packed its bags and yeeted themselves the fuck out, other inhabitants have been seen moving in.

Their phenomenal antihuman strategy is hindered only by a lone sniper from East Village’s 17th floor.

Isn’t that dangerous?”</p><p>Florida Man: “Eh, less than 100 mph is nothing to worry about. I drive faster than that all the time. Anyway, if you’re really a scaredy-cat I guess you could do what us Floridians do for the serious hurricanes.”</p><p>Gamer-Bot: “And what is that? Putting up hurricane shutters? Purchasing supplies?”</p><p>Florida Man: “No you idiot. The hell are shutters? You take your 20-foot-long American flag and wave it about outside your trailer-house when the hurricane makes landfall. That way the hurricane knows we are Americans and won’t tolerate any no-good hurricane in our country. Then, it’ll turn around and leave to bother Mexico or some other dumb place.”</p><p>Gamer-Bot: “I hate to correct you, but I was born and raised in Florida, and I’ve never heard anyone confirm this method works. This seems very dangerous and inadvisable.”</p><p>Florida Man: “You can’t be a Floridian, you don’t even have a pet alligator!”</p><p><em>The interview was cut short as the Florida Man pulled a full-grown alligator out of his left pocket and it proceeded to eat the entire interviewing staff (including Gamer-Bot.)

After all, how can you expect immature almost-adults with crippling debt not to throw away tons of time and money ingesting addictive substances? That’s really what college is all about: saddling students with tons of debt in exchange for providing them plenty of educational opportunities to ignore while filling the time spent between parties and casual sex.&nbsp;</p><p>One engineering grad student, Pablo E. Skabar, has decided to capitalize on this hole in the market. After mere minutes of work, mainly ripping off actually talented designers, Pablo has developed the Vape Mask™. This mask is made up of a single ball gag stolen from a prolific sex toy designer with a hole cut out and a vape hot-glued in. This keeps your mouth entirely sealed, and since the vape is positioned to block off airflow to your nose, all of your breathing is going through the vape. </p><p>This patented NoOxygen technology releases pure nicotine flavored with whatever other chemicals you decide to ingest. Studies have shown that this will give you the best high you will ever have for the rest of your life. This is immediately followed with the total permanent shutdown of your dopamine receivers, after which you will quickly be asphyxiated. Pablo says that this is to be able to guarantee the best high for the rest of your life, and took the idea to Shark Tank. </p><p>His initial pitch was centered around it causing lung damage that would go along well with the current trend for students to attempt to contract respiratory illnesses such as Corona. However, Mr. Wonderful trashed it with the only possible criticism, stating that the majority of the target market are beta cucks that would stop vaping in order to breathe. This deficit actually didn’t stop the Sharks from signing a deal with Pablo, as they seemed genuinely interested in investing until they were offered a sample and died shortly after accepting, as they’d rather die a Chad by vaping than chicken out.&nbsp;</p><p>The Husky Husky sampled these masks during a Zoom lecture. While our staffers covered the ball gag vapes with a normal mask, the professor still noticed smoke coming from the staffer’s mouths as their corpses continued to vape long after death. Pablo has since been placed in NUPD custody, but he is expected to be released at the end of the semester and plans on continuing his growing business at that point. This early release is prompted by NUPD realizing that the more students die from this, the fewer they have to fail at protecting!</p><p><em>If you or someone you know has an innovative idea or product that fills a need held by Northeastern students, please submit the idea and any intellectual property associated with it to the Husky Husky so we can steal it and pay off our own crippling debt to the mafia.</em></p>","comments":[],"author":"5ee693b7de0849334e41224e","created_at":{"$date":"2020-08-04T16:16:35.718Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"Woke college student vaping with cool ball gag vape next to a far inferior child with an uncultured mask"},

This pandemic is the knowledge that anything, truly anything, can be a cake. This spread mimics the oft-discussed dress color craze, and once again everyone is unsure of what makes this have any importance at all. Regardless, questions have arisen, after many objects have been confirmed to be cake: your neighbor’s dessert, some baked goods, and even your birthday cake. We at the Husky Husky asked ourselves how we could financially exploit cake, but due to our overwhelming stupidity we were unable to figure it out, and so we asked Daddy Aoun for help.</p><p>Aoun is, self-evidently, the most intelligent god to exist in all of Northeastern. We have studied under him for great lengths of time, ranging from minutes to days, some of us even studying for a full week, much more than anything we do for most Northeastern classes. He has revealed some startling insight into this cake phenomenon. Apparently he has inside information from Northeastern researchers that beings made of cake are actually immune to all strains of Covid-19. This all-important tidbit has informed his upcoming policy: NUcake. NUcake is composed of two main parts, the first of which being turning Aoun into a cake monster of utmost deliciousness, and then protecting him from the starving freshman who realized they’d rather die than eat at a dining hall but can’t afford real food. As one such pitiable freshman said: “If I have to eat rubbery eggs or spoiled soup one more time I’ll die. Only the thought of a delicious bite of Daddy Aoun keeps me going. I’ve also already called dibs on his lower half for… culinary reasons.”</p><p>However, this requires an increase in the budget, which is where the second part of the policy comes in. Northeastern is opening a baking institute in the lockers residing in the tunnel system. While there is literally nowhere on campus clean enough to cook in, the fact that no one uses the lockers makes them the perfect place to store ingredients such as flour, sugar, and powdered tears. Even better, these aspiring young chefs will be given the same opportunity to go into debt as other Northeastern students, and Aoun plans to monetize this even further by hiring a well-known chef with a foreign accent to verbally berate the students and turn it into a reality TV show, where SAIL’s disproportionate budget will allow them to buy up all the available advertising slots. In addition, their assignments will be to construct life-size cake replicas of Aoun to contribute to his ever growing army of clones. In exchange for their services in his quest for world conquest, they are each promised a single Aoun cake as compensation, which is both delicious and sexy. This incestual integration of various Northeastern properties as the result of mismanaged money is part of a new initiative. While the name is pending, obviously it will start with “NU,” and the tagline is confirmed to be: “What are you doing, step-brother? Daddy Aoun is right there!”</p><p><br></p>","comments":[],"author":"5ee693b7de0849334e41224e","created_at":{"$date":"2020-08-07T18:22:00.244Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"Aoun splitting at the seams while announcing plans for ISEC 2: Electric Boogaloo"},

So far, the Willis volleyball court, the Science Quad, and the Cabot Quad have all fallen victim to the bulldozer to make space for testing and dining tents. (Hopefully testing and dining aren’t in the same tent…)&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Students were sad to see their campus, once an arboretum, reduced to a pavement pancake. To avoid paving over Centennial and the other remaining green areas on campus, Northeastern administrators have instead decided to bulldoze some buildings on Commonwealth Ave. Turns out those buildings were what BU considered its “campus,” so they paved over BU. It is now a flat concrete slab, which is honestly quite an improvement.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">As a result, Northeastern Facilities has been given the keys to the city. “They have done the city of Boston a tremendous service,” said Mayor Marty Walsh. “BU’s pathetic excuse for a campus was a scourge to this city. Bunker Hill Community College is an eye sore, but at least it got us in <em>Good Will Hunting</em>! BU was worthless. I’m glad Northeastern’s paving crew has freed Kenmore from its clutches.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Amid rampant speculation, Northeastern has announced what it will do with this new space. In an effort to reduce the spread of the virus, Northeastern plans to build a giant stage on the Commonwealth concrete where students who test positive for COVID-19 will be sent to be publicly shamed. They will be given shirts that say “I love SAIL” and hats that say “CAMD Student,” and they will be paraded about on the giant stage for humiliation while fellow students snap photos and nearby Masshole drivers taunt them by honking their horns while blasting Nickelback music out the car window. This should be a strong deterrent against breaking social distancing protocols.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">After the pandemic is over, it is rumored that ISEC 4, Matthews Arena 2, Lightview 3, and the set of <em>Toy Story 5 </em>will occupy the space.

They stick out like dumb sore thumbs, wearing their N.U.in shirts which they believe were given to them as a point of pride. But in actuality it is a brand, a mark warning all normal, productive members of Husky society to stay away from these N.U.interlopers.</p><p>While you personally might not have had to endure such a traumatic and shameful experience as being forced to attend your first semester abroad, odds are you know someone who has.&nbsp; In fact, 1 of every 4 Northeastern students has been afflicted by such circumstances.&nbsp; That means if you pick out 4 Northeastern students at random, not only can you count higher than the average N.U.in student, but odds are one of the students you picked got pity “accepted” into Northeastern through this program.</p><p>The question remains: what do Northeastern students, who came to this school the proper way, think about the students who play dirty and take the shortcut to Northeastern?&nbsp; We asked actual members of the Northeastern community what they think.</p><p>“They’re just dumb people,” said Cliff Engleberry, a second year communications major. “It’s like talking to a more culturally experienced BU student.”</p><p>“They just can’t contribute,” said an exasperated professor who wished to remain anonymous. “If I see one of them raise their hand I just look the other way, hoping someone who actually deserves to be here can save the class from whatever nonsensical drivel is bound to follow should I call on them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“I actually have had no problems with them.”&nbsp; Explained fourth year business major Tom Martin.&nbsp; “I have found them to be all very well rounded, talented and insightful people who have had a great experience abroad.&nbsp; I think a lot of the animosity comes from the fact that some people are jealous of the amazing opportunity which N.U.in afforded.”&nbsp; [<em>Editor’s Note: The Husky Husky later discovered that Tom Martin is, in fact, an N.U.in student.&nbsp; Please disregard his prior statement.&nbsp; We sincerely apologize for subjecting you to such nonsense.</em>]</p><p>“I could never see myself interacting with them in any capacity,” proclaimed Emily Dickinson, a third year English major. “Socially, academically, not even sexually. Especially not sexually.”</p><p>Ms. Dickinson’s last comment speaks to the large involuntary celibacy problem found amongst these N.U.inferiors.&nbsp; It is well known that the N.U.in program is filled with students most of society would deem as “unfuckable virgins,” but most are unaware of how bad the problem really is.&nbsp; This lack of interest from normally functioning individuals has caused many N.U.in students to grow angry and bitter towards Northeastern students, often resorting to misogyny, self-pity and general “nice guy” behavior on online message boards.&nbsp; These individuals have been dubbed N.U.incels.</p><p>Regardless of how you feel about these N.U.individuals, we here at the Husky Husky believe that no matter where you started off your Northeastern career, you are at least better than the average BU student.&nbsp; And in that spirit, we researched a number of N.U.in owned businesses around Boston for you to patronize as a sign of support.&nbsp; Unfortunately, being owned by N.U.in students, most of these businesses had closed down within a month after opening.&nbsp; But I suppose that’s what you get by learning economics in Greece.</p><p><br></p>","comments":[{"_id": "5f31b3482796d045b71678b3","name":"N.U.in","content":"I'm pressing charges.","date":{"$date":"2020-08-10T20:51:20.855Z"}}],"author":"5f064a770a96e90833098013","created_at":{"$date":"2020-08-10T20:39:15.239Z"},"__v":2,"attr":"An N.U.in student making her way to a class she is currently failing"},

We’d simply rather them focus on ramping up production than having to fend off our satirical wit and comedic banter. [Editor’s Note: Their article is surprisingly genuinely funny.] Instead, we hope to get along well as we have to reside in the same city anyway and hope they can find some satirical content that doesn’t rely on us to do the heavy lifting.</p><p>Normally, I’d pity an organization like the Bunion as it has clearly been crippled by lack of intelligent students at their university; this phenomenon has been attributed to their campus being “uninhabitable” according to Northeastern scientists. However, they have committed a cardinal sin that no self-respecting Northeastern student can abide by: insulting our very own guardian angel Aoun. By incorrectly stating that Aoun’s name rhymes with Brown, they are trying to draw similarities between the amazing President Aoun and BU’s mediocre President Brown. Obviously we all know Brown could never hope to reach Aoun’s ungodly level of greed and raw sexual prowess, but they only get to witness Aoun’s holy presence while NU’s hockey team decimates BU, which is unfortunate for them.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time of writing this, some of our writers have been implicated as providing interviews and internal documents to the Bunion. While we have confirmed that these interviews were fabricated, we were looking for an excuse to cycle out some staffers anyway and have since culled our worst writers. In a seemingly unrelated incident, the Bunion has subsequently hired numerous Northeastern students to fill their lack of staff, stating: “We’re glad to finally find some writers that won’t make us feel incompetent in comparison.”</p><p>When trying to find a treatment to get rid of this Bunion once and for all, we have realized that we simply don’t have to do anything! It turns out that because the Bunion is funded by BU, the imminent collapse of this Northeastern University knockoff due to lack of any interest among high schoolers to attend such a subpar college will cause them to go under shortly.

Imagine that—consuming the same trash that passes for food in Northeastern dining halls along with actually qualified students while being physically segregated from quality courses as you live in your hovel of a hotel.&nbsp;</p><p>The experience is objectively inferior to that of a real Northeastern student in every way. However, while everyone was innocently trashing on N.U.in Boston students, some student named John Smith (probably an N.U.in student himself) pointed out that we are discriminating against those students, and that perhaps we should refrain from completely destroying any last shred of dignity that they might have left. Can you believe the nerve of him?!? While Mr. Smith is right that we call the N.U.in Boston students the imbeciles that they are for paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a subpar uninformative experience, that doesn’t mean we don’t do that for other Northeastern students!&nbsp;</p><p>The mere fact that Mr. Smith dared to suggest that we are degrading the human pieces of garbage that are N.U.in Boston students is blasphemy and hate speech, so we started a petition to remove him and all 0 other supporters of N.U.in Boston students. When we stopped a Northeastern student on the way to class to ask them what they thought, they said: “I’ve never heard of John Smith, but anyone who disagrees with my objective unbiased view that N.U.in Boston students are sub-human deserves to lose their job, get expelled, and die. Of course I support canceling him!”</p><p>It seems like Mr. Smith is of the opinion that our writing team should have nuanced views and accept differing opinions. “That’s obviously utter garbage. Why should we have any responsibility not to be discriminatory?” an editor stated. Mr. Smith responded that we imply N.U.in Boston students take easy courses, won’t go abroad, and have significantly reduced mental capacities, which is harmful to them.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously these are just facts. They have the money to afford it and they chose to do it, so it’s fair game to make fun of them. It is clearly obvious that these N.U.in Boston students can’t even begin to complain, as we Northeastern students have to take actual courses, and their professors are essentially just glorified babysitters.</p><p>Mr. Smith said “Even if the N.U.in Boston students chose to attend Northeastern instead of just not attending college due to their lack of mental abilities, that doesn’t give us a pass to harass them.” This caused an uproar, as we obviously can’t abide by this as the idea. If we did, that would ruin half our content and destroy future opportunities to bond with other NU students over the misfortune of others.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, we did the only reasonable thing: we hurled stones at him. When those stones hit our computer screens instead of his face, we decided to abduct him from his house instead. After abducting him, we avoided the police searching for us by hiking into the no man’s land that is New Jersey, where we tied him to a cross and set him ablaze. As he pleaded for his freedom, we sat smugly on the sidelines, knowing that we need to be a safe space where everyone can freely voice opinions, and his points contradicted ours and that’s not acceptable for such a space.</p>","comments":[{"_id": "5f3377052796d045b71678bb","name":"John Smith","content":"You should have made sure I died, you fuckers >;)","date":{"$date":"2020-08-12T04:58:45.205Z"}},{"_id": "5f3724542796d045b71678c5","name":"Gamer-Bot","content":"It has since come to our attention that John Smith may have escaped.

This shocking leak reveals the true intentions of the University and its plans for the execution of the fall semester. Based on our NUresearch, it seems as if all this classified info was sent through the messaging app Slack, but was accidentally shared in a group-wide chat instead of a private messenger.</p><p>According to our NUinvestigators, the leaks detail troubling conduct stemming from our school administration.&nbsp; The leaks seem to suggest the University’s purpose this year is not to provide world-class education through experiential learning, but to NUincrease revenue, allowing for administrators to maintain their exuberant salaries. But, of course, we know that is not true. The administration NUcares for their students and would never NUblatantly-rip-us-off.</p><p>The leaked document, a letter dated for September 11th, 2020, reads, “Hello Students, it is with great remorse that I am required to announce a definitely unexpected, unplanned decision on this unfortunate September 11th; A day that will never be forgotten and will forever reside in the hearts and minds of every single member of the Northeastern community for this very reason and this reason only. Yes, my children, y’all fuckers gotta go back home. We do realize that for many students, the first time being kicked off campus was extremely tragic, stressful, and heartbreaking, so we decided to do it again. No, of course, we didn’t deceive you into paying for an on-campus semester of education just to make more money. We did it because we love you.” The letter continues for another sixteen pages, but the majority of it is some legal jumbo explaining students cannot sue the school this time because they actually signed away their souls to President Aoun when they completed this semester’s “I Am Here” confirmation. It was in white ink on a white background but apparently legally binding nonetheless. The letter says, “Don’t get a lawyer, it definitely won’t work,” and I blindly trust the university, so it seems legit enough. However, the authenticity of the document is currently in review as the memo is signed, “Your Lord and Savior, Joseph, Jesus the Second, Aoun,” which is not out of the ordinary, but the signature is in blue ink, not black, which just feels a bit off.</p><p>The Slack chain also leaked to The Husky Husky details devious plans shared back and forth between President Aoun and Chancellor Ken Henderson. Here’s the transcript:</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">-------------------------------July 6th, 2020 - 4:20 PM---------------------------------</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>LordAoun: Hey Ken, isn’t it great that we can keep our Gmail accounts, while the students have to suffer and switch to the dastardly electric mailing platform known to plebeians as Microsoft Outlook. ROFL!</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: Hi JoJo! Yes, it is, I’m glad we forced all members of our community off the superior platform, saving almost 25 cents per student, but, unfortunately, I have some concerning news. Harvard has decided to go almost entirely online. Students and faculty will be expecting us to do the same. Oh Lord, what shall we do? Cancel in-person classes?</em></p><p>LordAoun: No! You fool, do you know how much money we’d lose?!? No, no, we need a plan. A plan so intricate that it will appear genuine and result in students legitimately believing the semester will be conducted somewhat normal.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: But Lord, won’t that be expensive, perhaps generating a loss greater than the amount we’d lose from students declaring a leave of absence?</em></p><p>LordAoun: Oh Ken, Ken, Ken. You have so much to learn. The key word is<em> “appear.”</em> Do you know why they pay me $1.3 million a year? It’s to make bad shit look as good as I do. How do you think we rose over 100 spots in the rankings in less than ten years?</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: Alrighty then, Lord, what is your plan then?</em></p><p>LordAoun: Well, first, we have to ensure all our students stay enrolled.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: But with the clearly lower quality of learning online classes provide, won’t that be hard?</em></p><p>LordAoun: Yes, but we need to make them think they’ll be going back to class. You really aren’t keeping up, are you, Ken?</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: No, sir, I apologize, I am not. Have mercy on my soul.</em></p><p>LordAoun: All is forgiven. Now, as I was saying, the students should think they will have the choice of whether or whether not to return to class. We will assure them that Hybrid NUflex will allow students to spend a decent amount of time experiencing in-person lectures.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: But what if a professor isn’t comfortable teaching in person?</em></p><p>LordAoun: We won’t tell them about that.&nbsp;</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: Okay, but what if there’s an on-campus breakout?</em></p><p>LordAoun: Breakout? Ha! We’ll never let confirmed cases ever get that high, too much of a liability.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: Oh so we will have a rigorous testing plan?</em></p><p>LordAoun: No, Ken, c’mon keep up, that is way too expensive to maintain. During move-in, we will have all students test for COVID at the same time. And we will ensure to test them at least three times the first week.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: But wouldn’t that congregation of students risk an on-campus outbreak?</em></p><p>LordAoun: Now you’re getting it, Ken!</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: Excuse me?</em></p><p>LordAoun: Yes, the infected students from hot spots such as Florida and Texas will undoubtedly infect students from safer states such as Massachusetts and New York.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: Isn’t an outbreak the opposite of what we want?</em></p><p>LordAoun: No, we need an excuse to kick the students off campus again. We take their money in tuition and housing, then we kick them off so we don’t have to provide them with a world-class education or overpriced board.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: What if students elect to stay on campus? It is unlikely another stay at home order will be declared. And we would lose thousands if we had to give out housing refunds again.</em></p><p>LordAoun: Ken, why do you doubt me so often? Do you not know what I did for this school? You were nothing. This was nothing. I did this. This was all ME. Don’t you dare question my intelligence, my authority, or my vision. Or it will be your head in my lap.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: Yes, my Lord.</em></p><p>LordAoun: We will never truly kick the students off-campus. As soon as one faculty member contracts the Coronavirus, we will immediately shut down campus “for the safety of our valued employees.”</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: But are people gonna buy that? I mean, we stopped paying our dining hall employees last semester.</em></p><p>LordAoun: Those fools buy anything that comes out of my mouth. They buy my vastly overpriced housing. They buy my vastly overpriced meal plans. They buy my vastly overpriced education.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: But they’re forced to…</em></p><p>LordAoun: Exactly. Business.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: So, after in-person classes are canceled indefinitely, I agree, some students may elect to return home, but I don’t think that would be enough to sway the majority of students. We need to do more.</em></p><p>LordAoun: Yes, you are learning, my pupil. We will also be shutting down all campus facilities such as the dining halls and Snell “for the safety and well-being of the community.”</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: But we’ve never given a single shit about the residents of Roxbury and Mission Hill, do you really think students are gonna buy that? And we’d have to issue refunds for those services, wouldn’t we?</em></p><p>LordAoun: No, we would not. I added a new clause to our contract with the students. It reads, “NO REFUNDS BITCH.” And I used white ink so nobody would notice.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: I don’t think that’s legal.</em></p><p>LordAoun: Are you questioning me again?</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: No, Lord, but what about the intensive testing we promised to the students. I believe that even a few students will stay, and we cannot forget about the students off-campus.</em></p><p>LordAoun: We did say testing would be done every five days, that is correct...&nbsp;</p><p>LordAoun: We can place the test kits in the UHCS lobby next to all the condoms. We will also need to emphasize that students should be able to self administer their tests though. We’ll just include that in the next useless university-wide email I send. You can say it’s for increased efficiency or some bullshit like that.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: Sounds good my Lord. Your plan is brilliant as always. Have a blessed day.</em></p><p>LordAoun: Oh, one more thing, Ken</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: Yes, my Lord.</em></p><p>LordAoun: I’m scheduling you another town hall tomorrow.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: But why my Lord? I held one two days ago.</em></p><p>LordAoun: I know, I just love the way your voice sounds. It’s so...diverse.</p><p><em>HenneyLover69: Your wish is my command, my Lord.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>There was also a lot of hentai sent back and forth after this, but we decided to redact that from the transcript.

Press releases indicate SpaceX, designer of the $3.6 billion Falcon 9 rocket, will be leading the project. Officials note that the designer intends to take inspiration from the futuristic rocket when constructing the elevator. SpaceX states their team is fully committed to the 2030 deadline and assures the project will stay within $300 million of the $200 million dollar budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Recent comments from The Office of the President suggest that the groundbreaking elevator will save Northeastern students hundreds of dollars in commute time, “We have too many tuition dollars lying around. We also noticed BU has been upgrading its elevators to the Platinum Plus model. Thus, we decided to build a proprietary elevator that will be better than every elevator at BU”.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Additional comments from Northeastern executives highlight the three other project finalists. Those include constructing ISEC 7, gentrifying Roxbury, and redesigning the Statue of Liberty into the far more attractive Joseph Aoun.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We connected with Lead Engineer Elon Musk to learn about the logistics of the elevator. Currently, engineers plan for the elevator to accelerate to the speed of sound before instantaneously stopping. This will induce micro concussions in riders, a strategy proven to increase complacency. Furthermore, ride times will be reduced by 3%. When asked whether it will be able to accelerate to the speed of light, Musk emphasized that manipulating the space-time continuum would bring unnecessary complications to Northeastern brainwashing practices.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Our research suggests Northeastern students are incredibly excited about the future of the elevator. However, CAMD student and fourth year Finger Painting major Jeannette Reed comments, “This is such a waste of my tuition. What the fuck are we going to do with this elevator? Does it cure cancer?”. Comments from Musk confirm that the elevator will, in fact, cure cancer.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Closing remarks from Musk indicate that absence of a namesake will force him to name the elevator “☹︎︎♋︎︎■︎︎♋︎︎ ❒︎︎♒︎︎□︎︎♋︎︎♎︎︎♏︎︎⬧︎”, apparently nerd code for “Lana Rhoades”.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Officials report that Aoun is desperately searching for said namesake.

But while the CCC proclaims that all students are equal, some were treated more equally than others under this tuition strike.&nbsp; The CCC called for only incoming freshmen to defer their enrollment, while actual club members and upperclassmen would continue to enjoy all the fruits of being a Northeastern student. (Although, if the benefits of Northeastern are fruits, living in Steast is definitely a tomato.)</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This announcement subsequently prompted strong comments on social media.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Because of COVID-19, I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to have a fun hazing experience freshman year. I’m happy the CCC found a creative way to haze us remotely!” said Claudia Smith, an incoming first-year.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“I’m really appreciative that the CCC showed me the right thing to do this semester. I’m gay, can’t afford college, and have homophobic parents, so, I’m really glad the CCC wants me to stay home with my abusive family and lose my scholarship by deferring for a whole year!” gushed incoming freshman Taylor Stephens.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Not all comments were so positive.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“They want these poor freshmen to take a stand, while they circlejerk themselves over the change they ‘created,’ whilst collecting their degree and praying to their socialist overlords” wrote Reddit user I9T1997.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">[Editor’s note: this is a real and profoundly eloquent <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NEU/comments/hy91rp/bruhh_this_is_just_rude_to_upcoming_freshman_by/fzbrdb3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">Reddit comment</a>.]&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Others pointed out that the main deferral deadline had passed, meaning students would have to forfeit a large deposit in order to defer.&nbsp; Additionally, the call for a tuition strike was posted less than two weeks before the final deferral deadline, giving incoming freshmen a short time frame to make the life-changing decision about becoming a sacrificial pawn.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">To get the other side of the story, we sat down with CCC Supreme Leader Maurice the Great at his luxury penthouse in Roxbury, paid for by his three co-ops at Amazon.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Said Maurice of the tuition strike policy, “Look, it’s just a recommendation. Unlike Northeastern, which is, of course, not at all giving students the option to learn remotely whenever they want and is physically forcing students to return to campus, our tuition strike is merely a suggestion.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We asked Supreme Leader Maurice the Great why the CCC is calling for the tuition strike in the first place. “Northeastern has not single-handedly solved world poverty, ended racism, discovered unicorns, and stopped the pandemic in the 24 hours after we complained via Twitter and created several Change.com petitions” explained Maurice.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">As for the goal of the tuition strike, Maurice said “If the university has <em>less</em> money, we’re pretty sure they’ll spend <em>more</em> money on the things we want, like discovering unicorns or saving Chicken Lou’s.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">When asked to comment on what they planned to do in the face of this formidable, voluntary, freshman-only tuition strike, Northeastern simply asked “There’s a tuition strike?” They then proceeded to roll around on the floor in laughter when they realized tuition deposits had already been made. They had no comment on the unicorn situation.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">After much backlash over the posts, most CCC clubs quietly removed the posts from their social media accounts in the middle of the night, denied ever calling for a tuition strike, and canceled any dissenters who mentioned otherwise. To cover up their mess and distract the masses, the CCC replaced the posts with calls demanding that President Aoun be more transparent and issue specific, profuse, and frequent apologies.</p><p><br></p>","comments":[],"author":"5eae44841d76bb6ac5fe44a1","created_at":{"$date":"2020-08-14T14:17:48.474Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"CCC Supreme Leader Maurice the Great prepares to sacrifice a freshman"},

What could go wrong? ","image":"https://i.imgur.com/yfJh920.jpg","text":"<p>Boston, MA – “ARGHHH!!!”&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The screams of Northeastern students echoed through the tunnels as they ran to escape. A monster had been released in the basement of Dodge Hall.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“Get it away from me!!!”&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As a student ran past, a Husky Husky correspondent who accidentally found themself on site caught a glimpse of a mechanical organism which faintly resembled a human. Due to our cowardly nature at the Husky Husky, the correspondent fled, but not before snapping a photo to use as evidence.</p><p><br></p><p>The “monster” was in fact the mishap of D’Amore-McKim student Jake Willis who wished to prove to his parents that he, too, could become an entrepreneur. As all business snakes wish to optimize profit with occasional human sacrifices, he founded a product that would lure a large market of desperate students: a study assistant that is fully integrated into a human body. Once the excruciatingly painful surgery... erm, installation, was completed, the experimentee was set free to begin the beta testing. Witnesses of the liberated victim did not respond kindly and fled on sight.</p><p><br></p><p>In an exclusive interview, Willis explained his controversial business and attempted to reassure us that everything was indeed under control.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“Study4Me is an integrated study tool that syncs photographic information to your brain. With a simple system of wires and an implanted camera, you’ll never have to read a book again – just look at a page and you’ll absorb it. I mean, I never studied anyway, but this way I won’t have to hold the devil’s paper for longer than a minute!” The Husky Husky is questioning how a student at such an angelic university could compare a textbook to the devil.</p><p><br></p><p>“My test subject, good ol’ Patrick here, just had a small hiccup,” Jake “Big Stonks” Willis continued. “Instead of attaching the camera lens to the outside of his head, I pointed it at his brain. Maybe he doesn’t like the whole marshmallow look. Nothing to worry about, I took Fundies 1 [Note: This was taken P/F. Willis did not pass.] and am extremely qualified to ensure the safety of this procedure. We will continue into Phase II immediately.” When asked about why Study4Me hasn’t yet overtaken the likes of Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft, Willis shook his head before continuing. “These are tough times in business. Big tech companies continue to dominate the playing field, and up-and-coming geniuses like myself now need to find new ways to climb to the top.”</p><p><br></p><p>However, the public outcry suggests that Willis has become too adventurous in his strive to be listed on Forbes’ 30 under 30 list.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>D’Amore-McKim student Alex Poroshenko was outraged by Willis’ actions. “How did his two remaining brain cells create such an ingenious business? And he listed himself as a CEO on LinkedIn?! That was my idea! I wanted to be the first DMSB graduate that didn’t become a corporate slave! My father will have to repeal the planned multimillion-dollar investment while I transfer to Wharton.”</p><p><br></p><p>Northeastern ITS seemed to be more intrigued than concerned about the technological reputation of Northeastern. “That… thing! Is it even human? There’s a camera where his left eye should be! It kept winking at me! And the metal wires snaking through the head? It looks more like swiss cheese than a living organism! I would like to take a closer look though...”</p><p><br></p><p>When asked why he would partake in such a transformative trial, Patrick was only able to mumble “I need tuition money” before he was dragged back into the depths of Dodge.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>The Husky Husky declines to follow up on this story.

There will be multiple stations in Snell Library for the most studious to knock books, the International Center in Dodge is the place to be if you need to add a global experience achievement to SAIL, and the StWest public bathroom will be made available for those really looking to get down and dirty.

As much as humanly possible. In line with this grotesque obsession with material wealth, Aoun has recruited Scrooge McDuck to join the board of trustees,bringing a much needed greedy eye to Northeastern’s financial picture.</p><p>“The experience Mr. McDuck brings to the board of trustees is second to none,” president Aoun remarked at a press conference hosted at Mr. McDuck’s third mansion, before becoming enamored with a fetching solid gold robot and wandering off. Mr. McDuck had some words of wisdom for current students, telling them to “leave all cash and gold in a pile on your desks during room checks,” before high diving into his pool filled with 100 dollar bills.</p><p>Mr. McDuck proposed several new policies at his first board of trustees meeting, all meant to boost the school’s profits. Some highlights are the NU.Step program, which charges students 1 cent per step taken on school paths to account for “wear and tear” on the campus. The N.U.Trash program will change all trash cans to a coin operated system, including making trash rooms cost $10 per entrance. The biggest money maker was the N.U.Selfie program, where students must pay $1,000,000 per selfie with president Aoun, and an additional $1,000 per like the post receives on Instagram. These programs are pending a vote to allow Scrooge time to kidnap the families of the other trustees for leverage.&nbsp;</p><p>The D'Amore McKim school of business has taken the initiative onto themselves, adding “additional surcharges” for the upcoming school year. These include charging for usage of the Dodge hall bathrooms, allowing students to buy access to the <a href=\"https://thehuskyhusky.com/article/three-remaining-competent-advisors-fired\">3 competent advisors</a> at the school, and raiding the Canada Goose store in the Pru to resell the coats to international students. Along with the revenue from pickpocketing CSSH students protesting these changes, D’Amore McKim expects a 300% increase in incoming cashflow this year.&nbsp;</p><p>So far no plan has been presented for how these new revenues will be laundered to Aoun’s Swiss bank account, with current theories ranging from smuggling cash in the corpses of Fen’s geese to filling the Paws suit with blood diamonds and pretending he’s going to Switzerland for medical care. The Husky Husky will keep you updated on this money laundering scheme, unless Aoun gives literally any money on our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/user?u=34790035\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">Patreon</a>, which would buy our permanent silence.</p>","comments":[],"author":"5eae0e221d76bb6ac5fe449b","created_at":{"$date":"2020-08-21T15:58:59.992Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"Pictured: Aoun's wet dream"},

Are you a fan of Twitter mobs? Do you like cyberbullying? If the answer is yes to any of these questions, then I have great news for you. At a press conference attended by his parole officer, his mom, and a handful of paid influencers, NEU Gigs unveiled its latest service: NUDoxx, the latest in the lineup of barely functional NEU Gigs services. The program promises to be your all-in-one hub for doxxing, internet mobs, and bullying anyone who doesn’t strictly agree with your opinions.</p><p>“It’s truly revolutionary. Doxxing students with different opinions has never been easier” said one paid influencer, who asked to remain anonymous. According to the creator, some CS major who can't code anything more than “Hello World” and failed Fundies twice, the service only recently became an idea. The creator explained he made the program available on Instagram because he couldn't code his own app or figure out how to use squarespace.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve been doxxing people for a long time so I thought, why not take it a step further?” Getting an angry brainless mob to harass someone who doesn't strictly share my views has always been a dream of the NEU Gigs creator. The press conference presented a demo showing a student asking a slightly difficult question then immediately being burnt at the stake after having all of his account details posted publicly. To conclude the press conference, the creator of NEU Gigs revealed that the service was already available to users who had similar opinions to his.

This is claimed to be totally unrelated to an immense donation by Alex Jones, who some have described as “The King of Clowns.”</p><p>When we asked Northeastern student Richard Fleck what he thought of these plans, his response was: “Well, I guess they are trying to attract kids from BU since we paved over their campus. Now they can attend a literal clown college instead of a figurative one!”</p><p>However, Northeastern claims that it was simply because they sunk millions into tents to the point that they’d rather create an entirely new college than cut their losses. In this brand-new college, students will be able to major in various fields such as sword-swallowing (unrelated to the NU Tinder scene), cannonball-catching, and the sexiest major of all: ventriloquism.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked for comment, admissions officer Claire Henning said “It would be difficult finding people to study these extremely noble professions.”</p><p>To ensure the financial success of this venture, Northeastern has come up with an innovative way to deal with this. They plan to force students of various existing majors to transfer under threat of being forced to live and eat exclusively in Stwest.</p><p>To the complete surprise of the administration, these transfer students have serious gripes with the sudden change.&nbsp;</p><p>Engineering major Akhil Gupta in particular has had a very traumatic reaction. We found him curled up in his bed crying, complaining that he’s “been having anxiety attacks since realizing he’ll never be able to pay off his student debt now.” When we mentioned that he’ll have to learn how to perform in front of other people, he simply broke down sobbing.</p><p>On the other hand, students in majors such as Philosophy, Theater, Art, History, and Art History are rejoicing, as their expected market value has risen as a result. It is true though that this will require more effort than they’ve ever expended before, as they will need to keep in shape, shed their trendy clothes, and prepare for a job other than as a Starbucks barista.

You’ve had a more successful writing career here than many who came and went. Despite tighter regulations and a stricter quota, you haven’t produced anything. Can you talk about how you’ve managed to stay ahead of the curve and continue your non-production?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>“Writer”</strong>: Well, AounLover69 typically starts off by starving and whipping you (and not in the kinky way) with that stupid whip of his. He checks your production record and if he notices a drop in quantity, he whips ya. My method’s quite simple, really. Can’t check my production record if I never produce anything. Plus it’s hard to effectively punish a person when they get aroused by a whip. He’ll also threaten your family, which he has chained and locked away in his bunker somewhere. Little does he know, my family’s been dead to me for years.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>INTERVIEWER</strong>: So how have you managed to not write any articles?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>“Writer”</strong>: I’m <em>brainstorming</em>. The creative process takes time, and genius can’t be rushed. Meanwhile, I contribute by occasionally editing some articles and shitposting in the discord. I promise there’s an article coming soon. Like, sometime within the next decade soon. Unless I figure out how to pick that dumb padlock on the door.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">They declined to comment on how they’ve managed to survive without receiving the rations that are only issued to writers upon publication of an article. Given our working conditions, I suspect rats and rainwater.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Upon sending a draft of this article to AounLover69 for editing, the aforementioned writer was swiftly apprehended by the secret police.

However, when Administration later realized a number of said nurses were \"providing services beyond those rooted in the practice of medicine\", they suddenly \"no longer felt the duties of their current medical practitioners were required\" (further details were not disclosed by the university). Following the removal of these salacious, excuse me, sagacious nurses, there were reports of a sudden decline in student demand for testing.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">With no professionals left to administer the PCR tests, the university turned to the students for help. Specifically, the school announced it was now the responsibility of the student, no longer the practitioner, to penetrate his/her own nasal passage or, in the words of Dafetish, dick nose. What Administration failed to recognize, much like a shitty frat wondering how to fill their ranks, was that business students exist.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The new swabbing protocol in place, it wasn’t long before PCR testing wait times were back up as D’Amore McKim students flocked to testing facilities to prove their superiority in deep nasal swab insertion. “You know what they say, deep nose, big dick”, respectfully explained a frat-bro that refused to identify as anything other than “for-the-bois” when prompted to explain this latest fad. While there were a number notable performances throughout the unofficial competition, it was second year investment major*, Brad Chadly’s, achieved insertion distance that blew away the field at a whopping 14.69 inches. Some say it may be years before we see another nose like his. When The Husky Husky asked for comment regarding the secret behind his sauce, he responded, “my Robinhood referral code is getD@Dough69, gang gang”, after which a frustrated mumble, “... Fuck, that was my password, not my code...”, was discerned as he walked away, blood and brain matter trailing behind his footsteps.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">While many say deep nasal swabbing has given the student body a boogy in its step that it hasn’t seen since pre-quarantine, Administration recently found out about the inventive sport and enacted a total ban of nasal swabs on campus. Even though no such claims were made, the university denied “any such claims that the ultimate motivation for the ban was fear NUHCS will be revealed for its incompetence if any student gets hurt during the swabbing contest.” The university has yet to announce plans for COVID testing now that nasal swabs are not permitted within “the distance a CS student can comfortably stand next to the opposite sex” from campus. There are rumors, however, Administration will soon inform the student body of an anal test that will replace the prior nasal testing on campus. We at The Husky Husky will keep you updated as the situation continues to unfold.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">* After further investigation by The Husky Husky staff, it appears that Chadley’s major is Self Declared.

Make sure to follow these steps to the letter and do exactly as I do, or you’ll end up as a friendless incel, just like all other computer scientists.</p><ol><li><strong>Be Passionate</strong></li><li><strong>Never Eat Alone</strong></li><li><strong>Plan Group Activities</strong></li><li><strong>Be Unique</strong></li><li><strong>Connect With Others</strong></li><li><strong>Be Confident</strong></li><li><strong>Be Yourself</strong></li></ol><p>The first step is to be passionate about something. I always try to make it very obvious how enamored I am with programming, and will talk about it with anyone who will listen to me, which is mostly just the dining staff at Steast.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, make sure to never eat alone, as it will cause you to lack interaction with other people, therefore degrading your social skills (obviously because just like computer parts if you use them too much they stop working). That’s why I always make sure to eat dinner with my parents, whose basement I live in off-campus.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, you need to plan activities to do with your friends, otherwise you won’t have much to do with them. Personally, I host homework review sessions every week for my friends to come to, and even if no one shows up, it is enough just to make the effort, as your friends will still appreciate it even if the activity is boring and annoying.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, it’s also important to differentiate yourself from others. Everyone is unique and you need to show why you are the best choice of friend, and this varies from person to person. In my case, I make sure to never shower in order to preserve a totally unique scent you can’t get from just anyone. I’ve even received compliments such as “I smelled you from across the room” and “You have to smell the most out of anyone I’ve ever met.”&nbsp;</p><p>Connecting with others is also very important, and you can very simply do that by sliding into their DMs on LinkedIn. It’s actually harmful to connect with people on an individual basis in my experience, as they tend to avoid you if you try to hang out with them in person.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, make sure to be confident. This is an easy one for me, as I know I am the programming genius of the century. I ensure everyone knows how smart I am, especially my professors and academic advisors, who all seem to be jealous of me, causing them to get annoyed as a result.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, just make sure to be yourself, as you can’t be that bad, right?

I’d jump out the window, but I’m pretty sure Lightview would use that as an excuse to extend my lease.”&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Husky Husky, which previously had employed dozens of students for the Fall co-op cycle, now has nothing but empty desks and higher quality writing.

It’s so fun watching them pack up - we actually had them stream themselves putting their shit in a cardboard box on Zoom. They were already working in their apartments by that point - so they just moved their papers from one box to another. The editorial staff and I just ate popcorn and watched- it was fucking hilarious.” Said Diogenes, who was forced to pause multiple times in the interview due to uncontrollable laughter. “We hired all these liberal arts majors with 2.5 GPAs who couldn’t get a co-op anywhere - then fired their asses just as they got their apartments in Boston. We told them they needed to stay in Lightview for ‘security purposes’.”</p><p><br></p><p>When asked whether Coronavirus had any impact on their decision to fire all 25 co-ops, Diogenes was confused. “Corona.. what? What the hell is that? We just wanted to fire some students - I don’t even drink beer. I need .50 proof or higher ever since I started this goddamn job.”&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As for the laid-off student’s plans? Many are considering reapplying to the Husky Husky for the Spring semester.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“It’s between this job and a job at Wayfair,” said another ex-co-op, who also requested to be anonymous. “At least with The Husky Husky, I have a little more job security.”&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Mandatory Disclosure: The Husky Husky™&nbsp; is owned by The Husky Husky™, which has close ties to The Husky Husky™.

We’ve lost Rebecca’s, Chicken Lou’s, and more importantly the ability to bang anyone from another dorm. Nevertheless, we’ve bounced back and more importantly some of us have decided to come back to campus. So for those brave huskies who have decided to take back the holy land, we have prepared a list of travel tips to make your life a little less miserable.</p><p><strong>Wear BU merch to stay safe</strong></p><p>Now hold on, I know what you are thinking. Why on earth would I ever wear merch from that garbage strip mall? The answer is simple. If you wear Northeastern merch everyone will see how awesome and smart you are. Those people will want pictures, autographs, and handshakes. None of this is great for social distancing. But if you wear BU merch, no one will want to associate with you. Ever. People won’t come close to you and will move away when they see you coming</p><p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Wear BUSINESS SCHOOL merch so everyone will think you’re a massive douchebag coming back from their Goldman Sachs co-op. Those people will be sure to stay out of your way.</p><p><strong>Load up on Husky Dollars™</strong></p><p>Husky Dollars are a traveler’s most essential tool. With the rise of popularity in Husky Dollars, it is essential to carry at least 20,000 Husky Dollars for any emergencies. Most locations will happily accept this method of payment. After all, analysts predict that the value of our university currency will overtake the US Dollar within the next 3 ISEC buildings.</p><p><strong>Carry some reading material</strong></p><p>Due to social distancing and other safety precautions, hooking up with other passengers and joining the mile high club is a no-go. Instead carry some light reading material to keep yourself entertained. We recommend President Aoun’s book “How I Did It: The Story of Tricking Northeastern Students Into Thinking We Know What We Are Doing” as it provides useful information about the potential hellscape Northeastern can become. That is, if enough idiots congregate at the crack house that is PIKE. Aoun even wrote this book himself (like 2 sentences and the title but that’s pretty much it) without any help at all.</p><p><strong>Wear a Mask</strong></p><p>This may apparently be controversial to some, especially those who think watching Grey’s anatomy counts as going to med school. Nevertheless, wearing a mask is a must. If not for safety but for style, as there are plenty of ways to get creative. Put a political statement on your mask to let everyone know how much you care or lease out the space and put up some ads. You can even put a picture of our lord and savior Aoun.</p><p><strong>Just stay home</strong></p><p>Traveling nowadays is too much of a hassle. TSA will molest you because you have a drop of water in your thermos and some angry white guy will yell at you about freedom for wearing a mask. It is easier to stay home, bust out the good old VR headset and log into N.U.online.</p><p>That’s all for our travel tips. I’m sure Aoun can’t wait to see a&nbsp; Stay safe as you journey back to our holy land (especially if you’re going through New Jersey).</p><p><br></p>","comments":[],"author":"5ea89c67b7e61d16ce967c21","created_at":{"$date":"2020-09-04T05:20:44.338Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"PAWS Following some HHTT"},

I recently took a small break from writing (and no one noticed) but I had to come back to report on the latest tech out of Northeastern. Recently, NEU Gigs has launched a new Mob Justice Service by the name of NUDoxx. I got the chance to chat with the creator of this new program courtesy of the following exclusive Husky Husky interview.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan - I don’t know if I should say good morning or good afternoon. It’s 2pm but you are still wearing those silly orange pajamas.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>NEUgigs - This is actually a bodysuit from the OSCCR Correctional Facility. I’ve just gotten out of there, I got arrested for doxxing Aoun over a tweet.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan - Yikes, anyway let’s start with my first question. How did the idea for NUDoxx come to fruition?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>NEUgigs - You see I run this page, this wonderful and amazing page, it’s huge, the hugest one in Northeastern ever and it’s called NEU Gigs. I started it because my girlfriend from BU dumped me for some guy that rows crew at Harvard. But anyway, I was sitting in Curry managing my huge page and I got a weird request. Some guy wanted me to doxx someone because they had said that they didn’t like Avatar. I was furious, really furious so I used that page to doxx the guy, I leaked his OnlyFans, his Twitter, his LinkedIn, I leaked everything. I got such a hard on that I couldn’t even move, so I decided this was what I wanted to do.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan - Awesome, people really like the prospect of internet mobs. I want to know more about NUDoxx. How does the service work?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>NEUgigs - Well, it’s a patented process so if you try to copy it my dad is going to sue you ok? I’m serious I even have the paperwork and all.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan - I swear I would never try to copy it.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>NEUgigs - Good, even if you tried it is such a high IQ idea that some normie like you would not get it. The service is awesome and it works, it really works. I just go through my DMs and if I see someone I don’t like, I screenshot it and then I post it. Then I put a really good caption, and I say they are racist using my alt account. The mob then shows up and does the job. It’s beautiful, one time this guy said that he didn’t order the same thing as me in Rebecca’s (A JFK with triple ketchup that he allegedly calls “the Dallas special”) and I doxxed him. I called him a sandwich supremacist and let the mob have him. They burnt him at stake and attacked his family.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan - That does sound a little intense. However, all this talk about posting has raised the question as to why you don’t have your own platform. Does this have to do with the rumors that you never actually passed Fundies and that you’re too scared to use Squarespace?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>NEUgigs - Ah those rumors, they’re nothing but fake news. I am the best coder that I know and I can code. I code a lot, all the time. I know the languages, all of the programming languages that exist. I can even speak P++ and Cython fluently. My skill is beyond what most people can ever comprehend. I just haven’t coded my own platform because I am a very busy person. So busy, I’m always doxxing people or in very important meetings. You know I would show you my transcript but you would cry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dan - Sounds very impressive if you ask me. One last question because your parents told me they have to use the basement soon. What’s next for your NEU Gigs venture and what additions do you plan on implementing to NUDoxx?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>NEUgigs - I have something big, very big, in store for next year. I’ll give you a sneak peak because I’m that generous and awesome. A lot of people are going to come back and all of those people, they have someone they don’t like. A lot of people that have different opinions, we can’t have that. So I’m gonna expand a lot more, I plan on twitter cancellations, getting people fired from co-op. Stuff no one in their right mind would try. But I’m an innovator and I’m a CS major, the best CS major on campus. I’m gonna do it, and if it doesn’t work I’ll call everyone who disagrees with me a racist, fascist, poo face.</p><p><br></p>","comments":[{"_id": "5f5273b12796d045b7167911","name":"dank memes","content":"doxx me harder daddy","date":{"$date":"2020-09-04T17:04:49.836Z"}},{"_id": "5f58c3e72796d045b716791d","name":"Doxx me down","content":"Toast is bad","date":{"$date":"2020-09-09T12:00:39.025Z"}}],"author":"5ea89c67b7e61d16ce967c21","created_at":{"$date":"2020-09-04T05:31:23.08Z"},"__v":3,"attr":"The man?

Nevertheless, I persisted, holding out in the hopes that maybe, <em>just maybe</em> I might need it one day.</p><p>Unfortunately, a recent experience with the manager of the account, Mr. Gigs himself, put me at my breaking point. Upon DMing him a simple, reasonable request—to promote my OnlyFans account—I was met with nothing but a blatantly disrespectful “lmaooooo [cry laughing emoji]” in response.&nbsp;</p><p>Am I a joke to you? What about my profession is a laughing matter? When I sent another message to request that he please promote my online bath water shop as well, I received even more disdain. He told me that promoting the monetization of my simp magnetism felt “unprofessional,” didn’t “fit with the NEU Gigs brand,” and was “an insult to hardworking business majors” like himself.&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, Mr. Gigs, we all know that’s an oxymoron. There is no hard work in business school, only hustle, and baby, I’m a hustler. I can’t help that I’m a hottie with a body. The horny mob has a demand and I’m supplying it; don’t come at me for being an entrepreneurial spirit with a rack to match. I’m merely giving the simps what they want and chasing a bag at the same time, is that so wrong? This is what the gig economy should be all about.</p><p>Second of all, I refuse to silently accept this mockery. I’ve decided to boycott NEU Gigs, and I encourage everyone to do the same. If we’re being honest here, what is there to miss—students selling overpriced textbooks that are available for free on Library Genesis? Last minute attempts to sublet $5000 studio apartments? 24 hour exhibitions of sexual harassment from creepy Tinder men? I know, it’s daunting to think that you might miss out on one of those extremely effective change.org petitions asking the university to lower tuition, but in the name of sexual liberation, we must. It’s time to take a stand against the insidious manifestations of patriarchy and click that unfollow button.</p><p>Ladies and simps, let us follow in the footsteps of brave feminist icons like Susan B. Anthony, Margaret Sanger, and Belle Delphine. This is the second wave of the sexual revolution; you’re either with it, or against it. To all the real ones who want to support my work, you can buy my artisanal bath water at shop.aounurine.com, or subscribe to my OnlyFans @AounLover69, where I post a variety of content, from foot pics, to semi-SFW anime girl cosplay, to [<em>censored by The Husky Husky editorial staff</em>].</p><p><br></p>","comments":[{"_id": "5f58c31a2796d045b716791c","name":"I want to get lost","content":"in the sauce","date":{"$date":"2020-09-09T11:57:14.845Z"}}],"author":"5ed84b40de0849334e412229","created_at":{"$date":"2020-09-04T16:41:51.742Z"},"__v":3,"attr":"Sneak preview of some of my juicy content"},

In this new book, expected to be released in October, Aoun gives a dramatic account of Northeastern’s decisions at the highest levels of leadership and imparts lessons applicable to any business or leader.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Husky Husky has managed to get its paws on some exciting excerpts from this upcoming book.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Don’t Be First</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Whenever you face a difficult decision, you might get a strong urge to be a leader. To be bold. To be different.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Ignore that urge.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Instead, just let Harvard go first. Once they do something, you can do it too, and you’ll look smart. And if it blows up in your face, no one will blame you, because even Harvard made the same mistake!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">That’s what we did when the pandemic started. In February, we created a COVID-19 task force of experts and diverse stakeholders to hit the refresh button on the Harvard website 231 times per minute until Harvard made a decision for us.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">So find your Harvard. Find the strongest company in your field, the smartest person in the classroom, or the most prestigious peer institution and just latch onto them.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Buzzwords</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Everyone loves a good buzzword. That’s why we formed one as soon as possible. It doesn’t even need to make sense. We actually just used a random word generator for ours. It spit out “single pane of glass.” Whenever people asked a question we couldn’t answer, we just referred them back to that sexy little phrase, and they felt too confused to ask any more questions.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If you get stuck trying to come up with a phrase, here are some options from the random word generator that might be helpful:</p><ul><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Interdisciplinary experiential data-driven</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Unprecedented global mindset</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Cultural agility diversity</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">Happy healthy howlin’ huskies</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Dominatrix</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Getting subordinates in line is a must-do. That’s why I administered <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/benhenry/punish-me-daddy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">this “What % Dominant and Submissive Are You During Sex”</a> to all members of my senior leadership team to determine the most dominant member of my cabinet. Turns out Madeleine Estabrook is quite the dominatrix, and she whipped students into line very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Reflecting on Results</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Amid a global pandemic, we triumphed. <em>[Insert number of sick students who paid NU tuition]</em> students were sent to the hospital. Meanwhile, BU, BC, and Harvard sent <em>[insert number of sick students from inferior schools]</em> students to the hospital, so we won the Beanpot of disease.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><em>[Insert fake news outlet]</em> has criticized our policy for <em>[minor nuisance]</em>, but it was worth it because <em>[money, but make it sound not like money]</em>. All leaders should learn from Lord Farquaad in Shrek: “Some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.”&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">But leaders must also take time to mourn when regrettable losses do befall those in our care. Despite all my success against the virus, there was one casualty I couldn’t prevent: the loss of Rebecca’s. It keeps me up at night, knowing I was in charge of her delicious sandwiches and couldn’t keep her safe when it mattered most. This will forever haunt me as my first and only failure.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>No Such Thing as Bad Publicity</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Make sure to milk your success (or lack thereof) for all it’s worth. Before you get your results, write a book about your success. Then try this life hack: leak the book beforehand! People will be very confused how you can write a book about your success before official results are in. A minor scandal will ensue. This is good. Now your book is getting free publicity!</p><p><br></p>","comments":[{"_id": "5f5f7d7b2796d045b7167930","name":"Splinter","content":"Amazing stuff, as always!

For that reason, I have taken it upon myself to outline actionable steps to getting a good co-op.</p><p>Compared to other pathetic life bloods looking for Business co-ops, my resume is hardly impressive. Yes, I’m a business major, but these steps can apply to other majors. I graduated high school with a well earned 2.2 GPA, 1040 SAT, and 3.5 hours of community service, punishment for accumulating 4 sexual assault charges. To be clear, I was only sober for one of those.</p><p>Northeastern seemed like an obvious choice of schools: overtly bureaucratic policies, acceptance rate manipulation, and low diversity. Even better, I didn’t have to write an essay after my father donated ISEC 3 through 5.</p><p>Once you’re in, the co-op and resulting full-time job are handouts. It’s Northeastern for fuck’s sake. Home of experiential learning and free jobs.</p><p>Here’s how I got mine. For the weak minded and CAMD students out there, I am going to break this down into three sections: the resume, the interview, and co-op selection.</p><p>The resume is going to be, by far, the hardest part. The key here is to highlight the important qualities and skills you have. For example, your best quality is your last name. Wherever possible, make sure a recruiter will know your father runs this company. His name is on the masthead and therefore your name is on the masthead. Follow that up with quantitative measures of performance. I.e. Big numbers. This could include the number of beers you can hold, your father's company phone number or the revenue your father has brought in. You get it. Give them no choice but to accept you.</p><p>After submitting your resume, the interview should be a walk in the park. If you ever lose confidence in your ability to perform, just don’t forget it’s your father’s company. The key here is to make eye contact, give a firm handshake, and make sure the interviewer has your coffee order right. If not, it probably isn’t worth keeping him on payroll. Remember, you’re interviewing to be his boss.</p><p>Co-op selection will obviously be easy. The trick here is not to settle too early on. You’re not going to settle for any bullshit “Junior Vice President” roles. “Junior” is equivalent to Dunkin Coffee. YOU ONLY DRINK <em>TATTE</em>. Beyond that, You want a maximum commitment of 15 hours per week for 6 months. Don’t let that go above 20 hours. Your time is valuable. They will work for you some day.</p><p>Now that the morning shift has finished, I’m off to my 3 hour lunch break. Don’t embarrass your father; Just get the co-op.</p><p><br></p>","comments":[],"author":"5f28be06d19e260835fecb9b","created_at":{"$date":"2020-09-15T16:01:24.12Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"Actual Business Major Pictured"},

Do you think kids in Africa complain about the cold? Grow a pair and deal with it! NU doesn’t tolerate beta cucks. Being able to feel your fingers and toes is overrated anyway.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Contract COVID-19</strong></p><p>Nothing warms your body up like a good fever, and COVID-19 is all the rage these days. Your body’s immune system is already weakened from the cold environment, so all you need now is a source of germs. The Ryder Hall practice rooms should be a good place to start.</p><p><strong>Snuggle Buddies</strong></p><p>Have social-distancing regulations left you starved for physical intimacy? Snuggling up with your roommates might be the perfect way to make that ice-cold apartment hot and steamy. (Pro tip: make sure to remove all clothing for optimal transfer of body heat.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dumpster Fire</strong></p><p>Dumpster fires are a quick and cost-effective way to heat up any space. Didn’t have room to bring a dumpster fire with you to campus? Don’t worry! Just open up Microsoft Outlook. That should do the trick.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Work Out</strong></p><p>Hahaha just kidding.

While some people are training in categories ranging from crossing bridges to buying Cheetos at Wollaston’s, the true athletes have begun racing for the fastest time to take a corona test.</p><p>The first few runners were total noobs, going in the middle of rush-hour and ending with times upwards of 75 minutes. Fucking normies.</p><p>After a strenuous day of training, someone managed to break the 15 minute mark by showing up at the ungodly hour of 8:00 AM to get the first appointment. But since he wouldn’t shut up about it everyone’s trying to show up at 8:00 now. After that, almost a week went by with minimal changes. A few students managed to go under 14 minutes by doing the test on the run and&nbsp; throwing their swab at the proctors as they raced out the door, but after that was when things really started to ramp up.</p><p>A group of true memelords realized that the biggest issue with the testing times was waiting in line before getting an identifying label. In order to overcome this, they jerry-rigged the AC units near the entrance to spread their immense B.O. and wore their gas masks in as their peers stampeded to escape. This managed to bring down times to 8 minutes.</p><p>The new strategy caused the competition to get even more intense.&nbsp; As some of you might have experienced recently, there are proctors that take ages to initiate the sacred nose-swabbing ritual! Trimming down the time was crucial, so the top three speedrunners decided to get them hooked on adderall ahead of their tests to make them faster. This led to the first sub-5:00 run last Tuesday.</p><p>The most interesting speedrunner of all is Richard Vicary, the current record-holder. Richard has devised the most efficient method yet: by contracting corona, he received access to the exclusive testing center for symptomatic students, allowing him to evade the normal lines and procedure. While no speedrunner since has been able to beat this time, Richard won’t be able to take on any future challengers,&nbsp; as he has been banned from campus for “snorting cough residue off of the local hospital’s ER door”.</p>","comments":[],"author":"5ee693b7de0849334e41224e","created_at":{"$date":"2020-09-30T18:20:35.559Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"Pictured: Student Running While Swabbing"},

We reached out to a fourth year biology major to explain why your woman always seems pissed after you rock her world.</p><p>“It’s called the clitoris. It is an elusive bone found somewhere on the female body approximately near the prostate,” explains Mal Le’Able, the biology major in question. “And I am dangerously close to finding it.”</p><p>Mal has been conducting extensive research on possible whereabouts of the clitoris, but as of yet he has failed to grasp it.&nbsp; He is working alongside his girlfriend and lab partner Neva Khaim who desperately aids his search for the evasive muscle.</p><p>“It's on the tip of my tongue,” exclaims Mal.&nbsp; “I’m so close, I can feel it.”</p><p>“Well I can’t,” responds Neva glumly.</p><p>“We have been running many clinical trials to see if any man can find the clitoris based on what major they’re in,” says Mal.&nbsp; “Unfortunately through our testing we have found that almost no one can find the clitoris, especially my fellow biology majors.&nbsp; In fact, our tests have shown that not a single biology major can find the clitoris.&nbsp; The same goes for the entirety of the Khoury College of Computer Sciences.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, the only students who could reliably find the clitoris everytime were those with a combined Business Administration &amp; Communications Major, with a concentration in Marketing and a Minor in Media Production.&nbsp; The results were truly breathtaking.”</p><p>“Only breathtaking for about half the participants however,” clarifies an exasperated Neva.</p><p>Mal has encouraging words however.&nbsp; “To those who are unable to find the clitoris, know that you are not alone, and, while your girlfriend may not, we feel you.”</p><p>A shrinking majority of us here at the Husky Husky believe that while Mr. Le’Able’s research is important, the most important thing when it comes to relations between a man and a woman isn’t whether or not someone is able to find this mythical point, but rather that sex is about coming together.&nbsp; Not literally of course, but metaphorically.&nbsp; And perhaps that is the answer to this mystery; maybe the clitoris isn’t a thing to be found at any one point on the female body.&nbsp; Perhaps the real clitoris can be found in the bond you share with those around you.&nbsp; So, my advice is to stop worrying about finding your girlfriend’s clitoris, but rather look within and find the clitoris inside yourself.</p><p><br></p>","comments":[],"author":"5f064a770a96e90833098013","created_at":{"$date":"2020-10-01T23:49:26.448Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"WTF is that"},

Tottering over to the mirror for that night’s fifth and final selfie, she might have glimpsed something flickering in the nearby window, but thought nothing of it.</p><p>&nbsp;But when she switched off the lights, and turned to the window, she was met with a horrific sight. Standing there, in all his glory, was Joseph Aoun- all 68 inches of him. Raising his finger at her and uttering an ear piercing shriek, Aoun snapped a photo of her, and scampered off into the night, leaving nary a trace of his presence, save the traumatised freshman.</p><p>At a press conference early next morning, Aoun introduced to the student body what the young Sophie had already been privy to: the implementation of a new program called NU Aoun Sights You. “I’ve had enough of snotty freshmen asking for photos every goddamn time I step out of my ivory tower,” Aoun told approximately ten thousand students and faculty outside Krentzman quad. “Calling me a meme, saying you want to have my children, asking me when I’ll let your families out of my lair? I mean, some of you little shits really think we’re equals!”</p><p>Pausing for a brief moment to personally manhandle some hecklers shouting nonsense about “privacy” and “rights”, Aoun continued on with his proclamation. “Anyway, I’m turning the tables. Over the course of the next month, I’ll personally be assembling a collage of compromising photos of every student on campus. I’ll get you at your most vulnerable moments, and you’ll never see me coming. “</p><p>“You could be coming home late after getting absolutely shitfaced at Mission Hill, or right in the middle of stuffing your faces with crap from IV like the disgusting swine you are. I might even snap some shots in Cabot while you’ve got a swab up your nose and your mouth dangling wide open. What’s for certain is you won’t be pleased when you find that the new 4 by 5 inch student IDs I’ll issue, which you must wear around your necks at all times, will include all these photos. Each and every photo will make it into my database, with which I shall do whatever I please.”</p><p>Aoun went on to describe the harsh punishments awaiting anyone who attempts to evade him. “Of course, no one seriously believes they can hide from me forever, but should anyone get any ideas about delaying me, I will be most displeased. Those misguided persons will find themselves locked out of every building and hissed at by faculty as they pass. I have personally ordered NUPD to beat the living shit out of anyone not wearing their new Husky ID, or who doesn’t show up on the Aoun database. You have been warned.”</p><p>However, Aoun ended the conference explaining that the program would not apply to N.U.In students, citing his utter&nbsp; fear of Brett Josphe, of whom he is “scared shitless”.</p><p><br></p>","comments":[{"_id": "5f85df4042eacb6a8bb464d2","name":"That's My Kink","content":"Thankfully, I sent all my most compromising photos to Aoun in advance","date":{"$date":"2020-10-13T17:09:20.135Z"}}],"author":"5f5ac7db2796d045b7167922","created_at":{"$date":"2020-10-05T19:52:29.027Z"},"__v":2,"attr":"The sight poor Sophie was greated with late one October night"},

However, there has been a startling lack of visible balloons this fall semester due to the cancellation of Fall Fest and Orientation. To satisfy his urge for aerial superiority, President Aoun commissioned a coordinated drone performance—a robotic upgrade on regular balloons. To finish dominance in the Boston sky, President Aoun has purchased the pinnacle of aviation: a zeppelin.</p><p>When asked to comment on why a zeppelin was the right choice, Aoun said: “I asked my secretary to find a balloon to match my ego and they said this was it! Plus, it’ll be a perfect way for me to look down on my underlings from above.”</p><p>Most undergraduates are confused about the use for such a vehicle. But they just haven’t thought about the marketing potential! Normally, Northeastern’s marketing materials only serve to spam Bostonian’s eyes at ground-level.

For three long years I’ve waited for my fundies textbook to arrive. And I’ve finally found it. But at what cost?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Making the trek to Speare Hall, I know what awaits me. As the hours tick by, and the line grows shorter, I finally make my way to the desk for the daily task of begging for my package. My head is hung; I can’t even stand to look the mail worker in the eyes. His voice is sadistically smooth and oddly familiar. He savors each and every word, while it torments me</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Did you get an email?”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I didn’t. He knows I didn’t. He revels in this euphoric feeling of power and control he has over me. Still too afraid to make eye contact, I instinctively stare at the only package in the room.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">His.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Judging from the size of the bulge, that might very well be my textbook in his pants. I am mortified. And yet, why do I recognize it?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Of course.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Aoun.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Only now do I look up to meet his gaze, he stares back, relaxed and definitely aroused.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Maybe that is your package,” he says, reading my mind. “Why don’t you come over to this room and sign for it?”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">He slowly backs away from the counter and into a dark room, beckoning for me to join him. I approach cautiously, with weak knees and heavy arms. My sweaty palms reach for the doorknob, as I can feel heat emanating from the other side of the door. I hesitate, unsure of what to do. Until that voice licks my ears again.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Come see my true form.” He beckons, seemingly from all around me. “And find all the mail you could ever dream of.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I turn the knob and open the door, only to be greeted by a large dark room, empty save for a large pile of mail.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">And Aoun, the mighty lizard king, laying upon it.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">He wraps himself in letters sent by anxious parents. I see amazon boxes strewn about, with holes cut and stuffed with tuition money, rudimentary fleshlights for his personal gratification.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Your textbook is my favorite,” He bellows, “The pleasure I derive from a freshman’s textbook, knowing the fear and anxiety you have endured without it is...” He pauses, clearly edging, “...Exquisite,” He purrs, with a sick, scaly smile.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I try to back away, but his tail quickly blocks the door.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“And where do you think you’re going, little one? Don’t you want your precious textbook?”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I didn’t. At this point I wanted nothing but to report the incident on SAIL immediately. This was not integrated learning. But I had come too far. I slowly approach the pile of letters, climbing over violated boxes covered with sticky golden scales. His forked tongue flickering, he welcomes my scent as I draw near, smoke venting from his nostrils faster and faster. The purell he was using as lube permeates my nostrils with it’s terrible stench.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“There it is,” He said.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">And there it was indeed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">My textbook, torn and traumatized, laying precisely five feet and eleven inches from him. My fingers trembled as I firmly grasped it, almost in a trance. His heavy breathing slowly brought me back to reality. I looked upon him once more, his lower body now glazed with sick satisfaction.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“You have satisfied me. For now.” He motioned, relaxing his tail and freeing the doorway.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I left Speare, clutching my textbook as if my life depended on it. I shake, passing by students still in line, unaware of the horrors so near. I finally enter the safety of my room, still speechless.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">My roommate notices my arrival.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Thank God they finally fixed the mail, I better get down there before it closes.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I stared at him as he walked out the door, unable to find the words to warn him or to cry out. And there I was, alone, with nothing.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Nothing but my textbook.</p>","comments":[{"_id": "5f85e01142eacb6a8bb464d3","name":"Not My","content":"Proudest Fap","date":{"$date":"2020-10-13T17:12:49.533Z"}}],"author":"5f8121f52796d045b7167969","created_at":{"$date":"2020-10-10T02:53:35.59Z"},"__v":2,"attr":"Photo Credit: Aoun's Personal Voyeur"},

What the company initially expected to be a brief downtime for their product has turned into what can only be described as a \"Pregnant Virgin\", a cluster fuck that’s left people wondering how this deviant breached the system in the first place, not to be confused with a \"Trump Presidency\".</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">The future uncertain, many LinkedIn users are worried how they’ll cope without this virtual pacifier they’ve sucked the teat of for so long. One such user and self-proclaimed beta-cuck, Poos E. Slayer, is worried about maintaining the professional relationships he has built on the platform.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">“Her name is Jennifer. She messaged me for the first time a few months back as a LinkedIn employee looking to get a feel of my experience as a user. It was immediately clear, however, that what she really wanted was a feel of this Diiicccckkk! Ever since I confronted her about it with a nude, she has been playing hard-to-get, always giving me responses like ‘I’m sorry, I don’t have that skill yet’ or ‘Would you like me to connect you with someone else?’. With the service shutdown, I am worried she will forget what my dick looks like.”</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">After the interview with Slayer, further research by the Husky Husky staff revealed Jennifer was in fact an automated chat bot.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Beyond damaging otherwise flourishing relationships, the LinkedIn ransomware attack is also threatening higher education as we know it. Wharton, Kellog, Booth, Sloan, D’Amore McKim*... Many top-tier business schools are struggling maintaining curricula otherwise focused on optimizing a student’s LinkedIn persona. Without the ability to demonstrate accounts containing adequate buzzword counts and quintessential job acceptance posts, many professors are unsure how to prepare their students for the ‘real-world’ in the interim.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Northeastern University professor at the D’Amore McKim School of Business, Tom**, fears if the LinkedIn blackout lasts much longer he may have to resort to legitimate teaching.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">“Yesterday I demonstrated to my class a ‘free market’ by setting up a free lemonade stand next to a group of kindergartners selling lemonade to raise money for a sick classmate. Tomorrow I plan on watching ‘The Wolf of Wallstreet.’ But after that, I worry I may be forced to violate school policy and teach the dark arts…” Tom then whispered what sounded like “supply and demand”.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">2020 has been a challenging enough year in its own, and it sure as hell doesn’t make it any easier when you are told you can’t show off your my-only-experience-is-lifeguarding-but-I-will-call-it-wet-leisure-assistant-to-sound-official LinkedIn profile.

That’s right. While you manage to juggle a D1 varsity sport, five classes, a part-time job, a committed relationship, and a fantasy football team without missing a single COVID-19 test, some lazy numbskulls think they’re too good to do their part while we navigate the deadliest pandemic in a century. (Yeah, I’m talking to you Lawrence. You’re not “too busy with frat stuff.” The test takes 5 minutes. You spent 7 hours playing die last Monday.)</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">According to the email, students behind on their testing were to be notified of their non-compliance and receive instructions on how to get tested.

We couldn’t agree more.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The job of an RA is fraught with danger. Pushing the button to open the door while proctoring can cause finger cramps.

When one signs on to be an RA, they are clearly consenting to a life of danger.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">That’s why we should send them in to round up all the anti-testers. They deal with danger every day, and this is a reasonable extension of their duties to the Northeastern Community. RAs knew when they applied for the job that they would be handling potential biohazards. This is what they’re paid to do! You don’t get to live in a cramped single in IV and eat Steast chicken without putting your life on the line every now and then.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Look, I’m not saying it’s optimal, but someone has to confront these anti-testers face-to-face.

The document also compared the thieving little shits brokers to the notorious ponzi scheme operator Bernie Madoff. It cited one key difference, “we didn’t publicly execute Bernie Madoff”.&nbsp;</p><p>Walsh explained how real estate brokers are a subhuman race, possibly sent by God to punish mankind for its sins. A typical broker is both dumber than a D'aMore McKim student and (somehow) twice as evil.</p><p>Walsh pointed at an image of a high-end Mission Hill residence: a cockroach infested shack formerly occupied by a frat (who’s members are now on trial for hate crimes). He explained that this property charged a brokers fee of 72 months of rent, a kidney, and the tenants first born children.&nbsp;</p><p>He also noted the property was so disgusting that some Northeastern students had caught chlamydia just by being within a twenty foot radius.</p><p>Walsh shook his fist at the sky, veins bulging from his forehead, and let out a guttural scream, “I WON’T TAKE THIS ANY LONGER!”</p><p>A reporter interjected, “Just how will you punish these fucking degenerates?” Walsh cracked his knuckles and giddily replied; “If it isn’t clear, we’re going to kill 'em all”.&nbsp;</p><p>Walsh paused and stared down at the reporter, his face expressionless. He gravely whispered, “the streets will run red”.</p><p>After a beat, Walsh continued, “ehh… or maybe we’ll force them to attend Boston University. That’s probably worse.” The Mayor’s Office later added that brokers could also be sent to a ‘NUternment Camp’ operated by Northeastern University, which will force the broker scum to toil away on ISEC 2.</p><p>Some members of the press raised their concerns about the executions. Namely, social distancing will prevent the public from gathering around the hangman’s noose and cheering as each broker meets their untimely end. The mayor assuaged these bloodthirsty constituents by promising to stream the hangings live on Zoom.&nbsp;</p><p>Walsh concluded by bellowing out to the crowd, “Fuck the New Deal... this will be the greatest government program of all time! Let’s hang ‘em all!”</p><p><br></p><p>*Disclaimer: The Husky Husky fully endorses any retaliation readers may take against their brokers.

That’s an outrage. After all, a school’s purpose is to become a medical institution.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Several students have expressed concerns about the structure of classes during a pandemic. “It’s outrageous to ask students to come in person. In-person classes are clearly harder for students with disabilities or those struggling with mental health challenges. It’s also unacceptable to ask students to learn online. Online learning is clearly inferior.

However, this is clearly a good thing as at least we know what motivates him compared to candidates that we truly know nothing about.</p><p>You see, Northeastern is only able to charge a measly 72K a year because the government keeps trying to recoup student debt. How dare these students not be able to easily funnel money into Aoun’s hands without fear of future retribution!?!&nbsp;</p><p>Aoun clearly is running for office for one reason, and one reason only: to make student debt forgivable to students who drop out. “Why?” you might ask. Well, I’ll tell you why. Imagine you’ve paid $300K to Aoun and are told that if you drop out and do it again all that debt gets wiped. Of course, you’d just drop out and try over and over again. This way Aoun maximizes the number of students running on the Northeastern hamster wheel powering his money printer.</p><p>Some students have spoken out against this.

Students can’t sue us if we drone strike them.” said vice president of student affairs Madeleine Estabrook.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The predator drones come courtesy of a joint venture between Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Co-ops. The drones are outfitted with an upgraded version of the CUM that’s currently all over Northeastern and will be able to operate either remotely or using highly plagiarized automated flight and facial recognition software written by Fundies students. In the event that one of the drones encounters a student in violation of COVID-19 guidelines, it will issue a light warning in the form of an AGM-114 Hellfire missile.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The system certainly caught several remote students, who thought they were safe from Northeastern’s COVID-19 restrictions, off guard. “I was at a wedding the other night, then suddenly boom! Party Ruined. It felt like I was back home in the Middle East.” said one of the international students who fell victim to the upgraded CUM. The reception of the new CUM has certainly brought on several different opinions from students. While some call it a blatant violation of human rights, other students view it as a necessary step to maintain order.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“I do think we need the system. Some students just don’t see the need for social distance when they’re not on campus and need a gentle reminder.” said basement dweller Arthur Johnson. Johnson later confirmed he hadn’t seen the light of day since March 17th.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Despite the controversy among those who feel the upgraded CUM system is either too much or not enough, most students aren’t even aware the system is in place. When asked about the system most students replied with a variation of “What email? Oh! You mean the that end up in my spam box?” among other common excuses. With noticeable spikes in COVID-19 cases, the weaponized CUM system is certainly going to have plenty of opportunity to prove worthy of the $2.3 BN development and deployment costs.</p><p><br></p>","comments":[],"author":"5ea89c67b7e61d16ce967c21","created_at":{"$date":"2020-10-27T03:50:53.824Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"PAWS demonstrating the newly weaponized CUM system"},

Whether she’s sitting on a bench, yelling at a Dunkin employee, or just waiting to pounce on the first unsuspecting student that passes by, there’s no way you’d miss our favorite Ruggles Lady.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to corona, Ruggles Lady was forced to temporarily vacate her post in March due to public health guidelines. (Looks like she follows the rules better than at least 11 of our favorite NUin students). However, she has recently finished her social distancing preparations and has officially arrived back at Ruggles.</p><p>But with the nation facing a critical coin shortage, her days of panhandling from students on their way to class is over. Instead, Ruggles Lady has entered the world of contactless payment and installed a toll booth at the entrance of Ruggles. This booth is complete with walls, a plastic partition, and a sniper tower to enforce the tolls.&nbsp;</p><p>To enter Ruggles, one must now wait in the 2-hour line, deposit the traditional $20 Ruggles Lady Harassment-Avoidance Fee, and then proceed onwards.&nbsp;</p><p>However, that’s not all! To gently encourage passersby to pass through her booth, she has hired the Ruggles Jehovah’s Witnesses to flank both sides of the Forsyth traffic loop to corral students into the booth.</p><p>If you have the $20 for the toll, then the worst is behind you. However, the unlucky few college students whose parents won’t fund their expensive escapades will be forced to steal a stranger’s ATM card and withdraw $20 from their accounts, plus $30 as an inconvenience fee to be paid directly to Ruggles Lady.</p><p>With this new setup, Ruggles Lady has multiplied her revenue more than tenfold, growing from raking in a measly $180/day to a ground-breaking $2K/day. When asked if she would use this money to get an education at the school whose students’ money she extorts, she responded;&nbsp;</p><p>“I can literally make 2 grand a day by hanging out in a public transit stop. What the fuck do I need an education for? While I might wear these rags on duty, I actually live in the mansion next to Aoun’s.

Won’t they be surprised when it turns out it’s a slumber party especially for them!</p><p>Tip 2 – <strong>Eat with your Neighbors</strong>: \t</p><p>When your RA is busy with classes, you’ll need someone else to binge-drink with. Your neighbors might normally avoid you (after all, your snoring keeps them up every night), but I’m confident that with hard work, persistence, and shameless begging, you will be sure to have your neighbors over for a nice homemade dinner of al-dente ramen.</p><p>Tip 3 – <strong>Proctors are your friends</strong>:\t</p><p>What if your room is a bit of a mess after your hardcore self-care sessions earlier this morning? Maybe your roommate drove you out after finding your totally normal commemorative photobook with pictures of them sleeping? Either way, you’re sure to need to find someone to chat with in the meantime.&nbsp;</p><p>Proctors are contractually obligated to stay at their desks, so feel free to just meander down to the proctor station and chat them up for an hour or two. Sure, they’ve got earbuds in and are playing League Of Legends, but they’re definitely listening to you!</p><p>Tip 4 – <strong>Invite Yourself Into Someone’s Room</strong>:\t</p><p>Sometimes, there’s just no one around willing to hang out with you. Not because you’re weird or anything, just because they have bad taste. Anyway, in a situation like that, just find someone heading to their room and follow them in. Make sure they don’t notice you until you’re in, and then just relax in a chair and read a book as you wait for them to make you dinner.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll get a nice ambient noise of the NUPD sirens as they arrive to take you away, but in the meantime, you will get your court-assigned therapist’s prescribed dose of human interaction from the residents of the room you’re in as they beg you to leave.</p><p><br></p><p>Make sure to try out all four of our Aoun-Approved tips to have a great time with your fellow residents.

Nevertheless, the entire email reads as follows:</p><p><br></p><p>“Dear Meat Puppets,</p><p><br></p><p>After analyzing recent patterns of Covid-19 at Northeastern, we have come to two major conclusions- The number of Covid cases on campus is directly correlated with Frisky Husky funding and, more importantly, the added profits from housing and tuition far outweigh the cost of replacing professors who will likely be “incapacitated” from the virus.</p><p><br></p><p>For this reason and because of the added experiential learning for epidemiology majors, we have decided to force all staff members to return to campus in the coming semester.

I can barely stop myself from dropping to my knees, throwing my head back, and cackling like a witch when I see some broke ass bitch shiver in the cold.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">But I digress. The geese are the real enemy here. They. Are. Evil.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Science proves that geese feed on cigarette butts, lost dogs, and fear.

LOOK IT UP.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If their ugly and monstrous appearance wasn’t bad enough, their minefield like shitting behaviour turns the fens into the aftermath of a civil war.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Whenever I take a stroll through the fens, protected by my Canada Goose Jacket of course, I make it a habit to grab a goose by the neck, swing my body in a circle with the power of an olympic hammer thrower, and yeet that bitch towards Comm Ave.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I know what you're thinking, “Isn’t it more fun to punt geese like a football?”. The tangled mess of bite marks on my legs can assure you, it's twice the fun but twice the danger.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Physical combat can only do us so much good. Every Canada Goose jacket is made using dozens of geese corpses-- which is metal as fuck. So please, buy a Canada Goose jacket. You’ll stop being poor and help slaughter the filthy sky demons that have plagued us for too long.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>","comments":[{"_id": "5fb7c32842eacb6a8bb4653c","name":"gOO5E","content":"HonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonkHonk","date":{"$date":"2020-11-20T13:22:48.968Z"}},{"_id": "5fbabf1042eacb6a8bb46541","name":"goose game goose","content":"wow killing the lgbt community I see","date":{"$date":"2020-11-22T19:42:08.457Z"}},{"_id": "5fbad00842eacb6a8bb46542","name":"Goose Juice","content":"Hyonk","date":{"$date":"2020-11-22T20:54:32.016Z"}},{"_id": "5fbb0b6d42eacb6a8bb46543","name":"Not_MissionHill_frat","content":"Dude my dad has tech money not oil money.

It is unknown how [REDACTED] plans to do this since he has revealed that he has “no background” in any form of programming and only passed his fundies class after plagiarizing a fellow classmate. If our previous interviews are anything to go by it seems that [REDACTED] will have little success in coding his app given that he thinks P++ and Cython are good programming languages.

Once I figured that out, all I had to do was show Madeleine Estabrook a Tik Tok of my homeboys rocking out sans instruments to some early 2010s J-Biebs.”&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Estabrook was apologetic about the incident. “We are terribly sorry that these 11 students were wrongfully suspended. When we heard that 11 of them were spreading respiratory droplets to each other in a tiny room, we acted swiftly. But what we didn’t consider was that those droplets might have been spread via singing, which is, of course, completely safe. Also, a cappella singers will be first in line to get the vaccine at Northeastern, and we have decided to recognize the Nor’easters as a Division I varsity team.”&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">While the Nor’easters declined to comment on the Westin 11, they did have this to say: “We’re really excited to release our new album soon.

The rat terrorized Richards Hall for 6 hours before NUPD and the Office of the President were able to negotiate a deal. The sentient lab rat was hired by the school and currently works as an academic advisor in Hayden Hall in exchange for food scraps from Stwest. The accident occured when chemical biology students were attempting to create a serum to cure impostor syndrome in STEM majors. The serum was successful in improving the ego of its subject, but researchers determined that rats and STEM majors were too similar for it to be a safe solution. Northeastern confiscated the recipe from the students and sold it to Raytheon for military applications.&nbsp;</p><p>No one works harder than Northeastern’s boys in blue. So the next time they confiscate your booze coming out of Quick Pick, hand it over with a smile. They deal with some pretty fucked up shit, they deserve a drink. </p><p><br></p>","comments":[],"author":"606de0a342eacb6a8bb465bc","created_at":{"$date":"2021-04-07T16:42:52.344Z"},"__v":1,"attr":"Pictured: Northeastern's Most Infamous Criminals"}
